    "description": "M923 is using the absolutely massive M939 chassis, so it's big, very big. Hillbilly got its name for the oxidised steel plates that were used to up armor it into a fortress on wheels. 3 seats in the front, 3 in the back. Back seat passengers can open their gunports to attack zeds, but because of their height zeds will not be able to get them. This part is still experimental and will see some improvements in the future, with aiming and animations in general.\r\n\r\nHillbilly is a gun truck first, so it is not meant for huge hauls since it has only 4 wheels in the back and the armor alone is heavy and is punishing the suspensions.

    "description": "[h2][b]'90 Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II[/b][/h2]\r\n\r\nThe Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II is a sports sedan that was produced by Mercedes-Benz from 1990 to 1991. It was built as a homologation special to compete in the German Touring Car Championship (DTM), which required manufacturers to build a certain number of road-going versions of their race cars.\r\nThe 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II was based on the Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16, which had been introduced in 1988. However, the Evolution II featured significant upgrades to its engine, suspension, and aerodynamics. The car was powered by a 2.5-liter, 16-valve, inline-four engine that produced 235 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. It had a top speed of 155 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 7 seconds.\r\nThe Evolution II's suspension was lowered and stiffened, and it featured larger brakes and wider tires than the standard 190 E. The car also had a distinctive body kit that included an adjustable rear wing, flared fenders, and a front air dam. The body kit was designed to improve the car's aerodynamics and stability at high speeds.\r\nOnly 502 examples of the Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II were produced, making it a rare and highly sought-after collector car. Its unique design, high performance, and racing pedigree set it apart from other sports sedans of its time, and it remains a favorite among Mercedes-Benz enthusiasts today.\r\n\r\n[h2][b]Features[/b][/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fully animated with visible passengers.\r\n[*]2 liveries with accurate colors for 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II.\r\n[*]Craftable armor protecting Hood, Windows, Windshields and Doors.\r\n[*]All parts are removeable with their own 3d models and item types.\r\n[*]Four seats,\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThis mod is made with support of Tanka The Maid.

If you\u2019ve found something that doesn\u2019t make you smile, please give us a shout!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[h2] Mod Summary [/h2]\r\nThis Mod brings some slightly challenging and more lifelike feel to the in-game weather systems. This will bring extremely hot summers (topping 100). This gives fatigue affects if temperatures aren\u2019t managed correctly.\r\n\r\nWinter will also drop well into sub-zero temperatures, meaning you\u2019ll need to deal with the environment like never before!\r\n\r\nAs always, our mods will make things slightly more challenging. We\u2019re extremely careful to always keep things balanced and in tune with the base game though.\r\n\r\nWARNING: We have NOT tested values at the extreme ends of the available scales. If you insist on changing the settings to options this extreme, we are unable to advise on the effects this may have on your world and characters!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[h2] LATEST UPDATES [/h2] \u2013 v4.0.0 - 07/01/25\r\nThis mod now fully supports B42\r\nThis mod WILL STILL work with B41\r\nFULL customization of Weather\r\nWe\u2019ve left the default settings as they were, tweak for you preference!\r\n\r\nv3.1.1 - 15/09/24\r\nLatitude Cap Introduced at 65 (Thank You Community Feedback!)\r\n\r\nv3.1.0 - 23/06/24\r\nMore Frequent Update Calls For Weather Added \u2013 Variable changes now fully working and take affect quicker!\r\n(Single-Player - on game load)\r\n(Multi-Player - once a month)\r\nHigher Default Max Temp Set (35 instead of 30)\r\nLower Latitude Value (40 instead of 41)\r\nVariable Caching Bug Fixed\r\n\r\nv3.0.0 \u2013 25/04/24\r\nComplete File Renaming Overhaul!\r\nWe Noticed some files in our own Modlists we\u2019re conflicting. As part of some large re-writes going on at the moment, we\u2019ve rolled out a new naming convention across all our mods. This should eliminate some edge case errors and pave the way for the new content.\r\n\r\nv2.2 \u2013 19/01/2024\r\nMin Temp to -170 Degrees for Cryo Enjoyers!\r\nMax Season Variation increased to 40\r\n\r\nv2.1\r\nSANDBOX OPTIONS EXPANDED!\r\nDefault Latitude Tweaked Slightly\r\n\r\nv2.0\r\nSANDBOX OPTIONS ADDED!\r\n\r\nv1.1 \u2013 16/10/023\r\nBUG FIX! \u2013 (Code Typo)\r\n\r\nv1.0 - 15/10/23 \r\nLaunched! \r\n\r\n[h3] COMING SOON! [/h3]\r\nNot Sure!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[h2] Main Features [/h2]\r\n\r\n[h3]Weather, Daylight and Temp Changes[/h3] \r\n\r\nThis Mod will bring:\r\n-       Full Weather Customisation\r\n\r\nBy Default:\r\n-\tWarmer Summers \r\n-\tColder Winters\r\n-\tMore variation in Season temperature\r\n-\tMore variation in Daylight hours (longer summer days, longer winter nights)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[h2] Mod Options [/h2]\r\n[b]Latitude Variation[/b] \u2013 This will control the position in latitude of your Game World on the Real World. We have set this slightly higher than the default to give a more accurate reading for KY and hence more accurate weather. Adjust this as you wish, further North (higher value) will result in Milder Summers, Colder Winters, shorter summer nights etc.\r\n\r\n[b]Max Temp[/b] \u2013 This will control the Maximum Temperature you\u2019re Game World can reach.\r\n\r\n[b]Min Temp[/b] \u2013 This will control the Minimum Temperature you\u2019re Game World can reach.\r\n\r\n[b]Season Variation[/b] \u2013 This will control the variation in Seasons between years. So think along the lines of 1993 mild summer, wet winter etc., higher value means more variation. We recommend 9 here to accurately reflect some of the insane Weather changes witnessed at speed in KY. Increase further at your own risk.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[h2] Our Other Mods: [/h2]\r\n\r\nKYR Meds, Delays and Cures:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029240588\r\n\r\nKYR Improvised Weapons & Armour:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3099108027 \r\n\r\nKYR Survival and Crafting:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2935985690 \r\n\r\nKYR Heavy Metal:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009338583\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[h3] Our Community & Servers[/h3]\r\n[KYR] is a Growing PZ Community.

    "description": "This is a realistic overhaul of a mod called Advanced Trajectory. It tries to involve as much player skill as possible while having PZ's RPG mechanics such as moodles play a big role during gunplay.\n\n[h3]If the mod is too easy or hard, nearly everything can be customized in the sandbox options.[/h3]\n\n[b]If hosting a server, disable Anticheat 12 to prevent players from being kicked from no clipping from True Crawl/Crouch mod.[/b]\n\n[b]If you are running into any errors, make sure you are not subscribed to any third party ATRO patches as they may be outdated.[/b]\n\n[h1]B41 + B42 Update 2/20/25: Check change notes to see info about previous updates.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed PVP not working when ShowSafety is unchecked\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Many changes and fixes to Advanced Trajectory. Watch the video for an overview of the core changes. A lot has changed so make sure to also read past change notes.[/h1]\n\n[h3]Gunplay (keyword is bloom)[/h3]\nAt levels 3 to 10, the gunplay works similarly to Resident Evil 2 Remake meaning the player has to wait a bit for the character to \"focus\" and aim for their target before hitting an accurate shot. For example, a player is aiming and standing still leading the bloom value to go from 100 to 30. Once the bloom reaches 30, it waits for a second or two before reducing to 0. A value below 5 (crosshair changes color) is what you want as it allows you to deal the most damage when aiming for the head, otherwise, it will be treated as body damage. So don't waste your ammo spraying bullets because you'll either miss or do little damage. Let's call this whole thing the \"focus mechanic\" for the sake of naming.\n\n[h3]Higher level = higher accuracy and crit chance, less chance of missing[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] levels 0 to 2: very bad at shooting with anything but shotguns; player is limited to only dealing body and foot damage, but is not limited to dealing crit damage\n[*] level 3: focus mechanic is unlocked which allows the player to get an accurate shot on a target from afar (can hit headshots)\n[*] level 6+: bloom reduction rate is capped and no longer scales, however the crosshair will continue to get smaller the higher level you are\n[*] level 10: player can run n gun and is a headshot machine (if stationary)\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Hit/Miss (Can be disabled)[/h3]\nWhen the crosshair is slightly transparent at a certain bloom (which is dependent on aiming level), RNG will begin to play a role in determining whether or not the individual projectile will hit their target. Shotguns give a significant buff in increasing the bloom in which the RNG will be in effect.\n\n[h3]Distance Penalty (Can be disabled)[/h3]\nCrosshair will get bigger after a certain distance. The penalty is less severe the higher the aiming level and the longer the weapon range.\n\n[h3]Moodles[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Has a Cold[/b]: sneezing adds a big burst of bloom whereas coughing adds a little\n[*] [b]Drunk[/b]: more bloom is added when moving and turning\n[*] [b]Endurance[/b]: aim sways a lot\n[*] [b]Hyperthermia/Hypothermia[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction\n[*] [b]Fatigue[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction drastically\n[*] [b]Stress[/b]: limits the value of how small bloom can reduce to and makes crosshair shaky\n[*] [b]Pain[/b]: slows bloom rate reduction, adds shaky visual effect to crosshair, and limits how small bloom can reduce to\n[*] [b]Panic[/b]: increases effect of distance penalty and makes crosshair shaky\n[*] [b]Heavy[/b]: Similar to drunkness, penalty when moving and turning is amplified. In addition, stamina consumption when switching stances is increased and more bloom will be added when switching between crouch and stand stance.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Weapon Attachments[/h3]\nIf you deck out your weapon, you will have a much easier time shooting. It can even nullify negative effects at a certain level.\n[list]\n[*] AimingTime(+) => Increases bloom reduction\n[*] HitChance(+)   => Shortens focus timer\n[*] Recoil(-)           => Reduces recoil\n[*] Range(+)          => Increases range\n[/list]\n\n[h3]True Crouch and True Crawl Support[/h3]\nNot required, but a necessity for a full and funner experience.\n[list]\n[*] Switching stances will consume stamina based on fitness level and heavy moodle level. Switching stances between crouch and stand adds bloom while aiming.\n[h3]Crouch[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] When performed, bloom is reduced for levels that have not unlocked the focus mechanic\n[*] Bloom reduction rate is increased for all levels, helps a lot when exhausted\n[*] Can burst a few bullets while ignoring the focus timer depending on the level and recoil\n[*] Is OP when your gun is decked with attachments\n[/list]\n[h3]Crawl/Prone[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] you get effects from crouch but better and faster time to focus (less time waiting at minaimnum)\n[*] recoil reduced by half\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Suggested Mods [B41][/h1]\n[h3]Alternative Crosshair for ammo counter near crosshair[/h3]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2814165668][img]https://i.imgur.com/VMisKHG.png[/img][/url]\nTo set it up, you'll need the \"Mod Options\" mod to make changes to the Alt. Crosshair. Go to your settings and locate Mod Options -> Alt. Crosshair, then set Ranged Weapon Crosshair to \"IsoCursorFade\" or \"IsoCursorOpaque\". After that, turn down the transparency of the vanilla isometric cursor in the main settings tab.\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/WPheCdG.png[/img]\n\n[h3]Brita's Bow Dupe Fix for ATRO (Brita users only)[/h3]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3132933898][img]https://i.imgur.com/8FF2EbF.png[/img][/url]\nTo get the bows to work properly, download the fix and have it loaded after Brita's Weapon Pack. Then go to sandbox options -> ATRO[DEBUG] and check debugEnableBow. That's all you need to do.\n\n[h1]FAQ (MORE IN DISCUSSION SECTION) [/h1]\n[b]Does this work with multiplayer?[/b]\nYes.\n\n[b]Do I need the original Advanced Trajectory mod?[/b]\nNo, this mod is all you need.\n\n[b]Does this work with existing saves and can I remove them mid save?[/b]\nYes and yes.\n\n[b]Does this work with splitscreen or controller?[/b]\nNo.\n\n[b]Does this work with other weapon mods?[/b]\nYes.\n\n[b]Do I really need True Crouch and True Crawl [B41]?[/b]\nNo, but it is RECOMMENDED for a full experience.\n\n[b]I'm missing my shots on zombies with 0 bloom. Why?[/b]\nThe mod's crosshair is not always accurate. Sometimes, you must use the vanilla's isometric cursor. Make sure the base of the cursor is on their center of gravity.\n\n[b]It takes too long for the bloom to get to 0, how do I make it faster?[/b]\nYou can go to the sandbox options and increase the value of \"Focus Counter Speed\".\n\n[b]How do I get rid of the crosshair's low framerate?[/b]\nUncheck \"UI Offscreen Rendering\" in your settings.\n\n[b]Does this work with Superb Survivors or any NPC mod?[/b]\nYes, enable \"Ignore PVP Safety\" in sandbox options so you can damage NPCs with guns.\n\n[b]How to get rid of vanilla crosshair?[/b]\nThere should be an option to hide it in settings if you press ESC.\n\n[b]I'm seeing 2 bullets being shot at once. How do I fix this? [B42][/b]\nOne bullet is from ATRO and the other bullet is from vanilla. PLEASE LOCATE ATRO MOD FOLDER THEN GO TO \"42\\media\\effects\" and copy and paste the tracer files (ignore vanilla backup folder) into \"steamapps\\common\\ProjectZomboid\\media\\effects\" to override. Do not enable hide tracer option in sandbox.\n\n[b]Credits: [/b]\n[b]???? and ????[/b] for creating Advanced Trajectory\n[b]Lisola[/b] for arrow and bolts and manual z aim code\n[b]Bambino[/b] for insight and help on the PVP update\n[b]dr fish / drfishetti[/b] for adding new bullet wounds\n[b]inkredibehl  for french translation\n\nWorkshop ID: 3036878362\nMod ID: Advanced_Trajectorys_Realistic_Overhaul\n\nWorkshop ID: 3036878362\nMod ID: Advanced_Trajectorys_Realistic_Overhaul",

    "description": "Adds raw materials and recipes to produce gunpowder and ammo from scratch and uses realistic amounts of gunpowder and metal for each calibre. Supports 53 calibres from 18 different gun mods and the base game.\r\n\r\nWith B42 many things have changed in Ammo Maker and most of the mod has been rewritten. The focus was to make use of the new B42 tech-tree that includes furnaces and forges for metal working. From dropping casings when firing guns and reusing them with castable bullets, to the production of casings from scratch mid to late game. There is also a forgeable reloading press for bulk crafting ammo now. Support for other gun mods got addressed with an all-new dynamic recipe system with centralised ammo data.\r\nAmmo Maker continues to focus on natural progression with unique assets and processes.\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2788256295]For more information about the new B42 version of Ammo Maker have a look at the release notes from 2025-01-10 and after[/url] ...

Controllers will have the current name of the gate, and will update automatically on change.\r\n[*] The Controller have a maximum range to work (can be changed via [i]Sandbox Settings[/i])\r\n[*] The Controller can be attached and used on the Belt (On a Gamepad, use the Left-DPad RadialMenu)\r\n[*] You can Double-Click on the Controller to use it\r\n[/list]\r\nThis should be everything you need to know to use get around how to use the mod.\r\nIf you want to know more and don't care about spoilers, I recommend you read the full [i][url=https://pastebin.com/hkmKRrBC]List of Features[/url][/i]\r\n\r\n[h3][b]BE CAREFUL![/b][/h3]\r\nIf the gate is locked, you cannot connect another controller directly to it.\r\nSo, if you have no controllers connected to a gate, and it is locked, the only solution is to [b][i]DESTROY[/i][/b] the gate and build a new one.\r\nThis is done for security reasons (MP).

With these tilesheets you can achieve it through mapping!\n\nAll assets are included in the mod as well as the properties that work the best.\n\nFeel free to adjust, tweak or edit them, but do not release as your own and give credit etc plz\n\n\nUpdate 1/3/23  -- Sorry if this busts anything for ya'll but I forgot to add rocks for different cliff heights -- they're in the pack now.\n\nUPDATE 1/28/23 -- THIS IS HUGE.  Thanks to Alree's insightful help, I was able to add a lua file that adds support for multilevel foraging. You will now be able to place foraging objects in the map editor on levels higher than 0 and be able to forage on those levels in game with this mod installed and activated!   IMPORTANT: THIS MOD MUST NOW BE ACTIVATED IN ORDER FOR THESE CHANGES TO TAKE EFFECT!!!!\n\nWorkshop ID: 2898065560\nMod ID: AzaMountainTiles",

Customizable in sandbox settings.\r\n- Adds a 1 point cost trait that spawns you with a hand torch.\r\n- The permanent shutoff date still happens, based on the random shutoff date from vanilla, but it can be overridden with my mod in sandbox settings.\r\n- [b]Now compatible with multiplayer![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Recommended with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2829087246]The Long Night[/url] and other horror mods![/b]\r\n\r\n[h2]Events[/h2]\r\n\r\nYou can trigger Blackout events using Lua mods or the debug console. The following commands are used to trigger events; hopefully their names are self-explanatory:\r\n[code]\r\ntriggerEvent(\"BlackoutsForceShutoff\")\r\ntriggerEvent(\"BlackoutsForceRestore\")\r\ntriggerEvent(\"BlackoutsRequestServerData\")\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nThanks to the Project Zomboid Discord for helping with the code!\r\n\r\n[h2]Latest Upgrades[/h2]\r\n\r\nRecently added features:\r\n- [b]Added multiplayer compatibility! Thanks to the help of Burryaga![/b]\r\n- Added weather effect option in sandbox (on by default)!\r\n- Added manual blackout trigger for playtests, modders, and server admins!\r\n- Easy new way to check whether this mod has triggered a blackout:\r\n[code]print(powerDisabledByBlackouts)[/code]\r\n\r\n[h2]Compatibility[/h2]\r\n\r\n[b]Though we have gone to significant lengths to make this mod play nicely with countless other mods, we cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that our mod will never have a conflict of interest with other mods that rely on adjustments to the hydro power state of the map or ElecShutModifier, because these are the fundamental variables of most power grid management in Zomboid as far as we can tell. Our mod does seem to be playing nicely with Restore Utilities according to recent reports, but please reach out to us on Discord if you have any issues, and we will attempt to help as soon as possible.[/b]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n[b][u]Check Out My Other Mods![/u][/b]\r\n[table]\r\n [tr]\r\n  [th]Specialists Occupations and Traits[/th]\r\n  [th]Bitten Trait Mod[/th]\r\n  [th]Immunity Mod[/th]\r\n [/tr]\r\n [tr]\r\n [td][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2908173425][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2008080431586528268/9F26CE9530A93CBD39A0DB97672613F42B323AAB/?imw=200&imh=200&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true[/img][/url][/td]\r\n [td][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2935667789][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2008079351201136842/8B770E89A4A2D6B2F4D8BE7B0901AFD9FA110637/?imw=200&imh=200&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true[/img][/url][/td]\r\n [td][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941971399][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2027222091498843127/6894AAD17749992FD9C963BBB1E0D41C13C21D7B/?imw=200&imh=200&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true[/img][/url][/td]\r\n [/tr]\r\n[/table]\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 3156268584\r\nMod ID: TomaroBlackouts01",

    "description": "[h1]Zombie Camouflage[/h1]\r\nWe've seen it in The Walking Dead, we've seen it in Dying Light, it just... makes sense. So why is it not in PZ? Well, now it is! Grab your machette, kill a zombie and start uh... dressing!\r\n\r\n[h1]How does it work?[/h1]\r\nSimply right click a corpse and select \"Use camouflage\". Your character will then take some time to do it, but once its done you will be protected.\r\n\r\nAfter applying camouflage, your character will confuse zombies for a set amount of time (Default is 60 in-game minutes). However, your character will be slightly tired from doing it, as well as (Optionally) queasy, as anybody would be. Needless to say your character will also be all bloodied.\r\n\r\nZombies that spot a camouflaged player will be confused, but [b]NOT[/b] completely fooled! They will still suspect the player, and there is a small chance they will follow them. However, zombies will [b]NOT[/b] actively attack a Player, even if the zombies charge towards them. They are merely confused. If the Player gets too close to a zombie, the zombie will finally distinguish the Player and [b]NOW[/b] will attack them, so stay away!\r\n\r\n[h1][b]F.A.Q[/b][/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]Does it work in Multiplayer?[/h1]\r\nOf course it does!\r\n\r\n[h1]Does it work on existing saves?[/h1]\r\nAbsolutely!\r\n\r\n[h1]Is the mod compatible with [...]?[/h1]\r\nThis mod shouldn't have any incompatibility with other mods, but if it does, let me know.\r\n\r\n[h1]Do I retain camouflage if I [...]?[/h1]\r\nYou will lose your camouflage if you leave the game, or enough time passes.

    "description": "[h1]Supports B41. Works in Multiplayer[/h1]\r\n[h1]An update for this mod shouldn't be expected until 2025. Definitely at least not until B42 has multiplayer.[/h1]\r\n[h3]A new save is not required[/h3]\r\n\r\n[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlfstr/pz-mods/devel/like_fav.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nA combat mod made from scratch for Project Zomboid.  [b]NOTE:[/b] This still needs a lot of work to implement many of the features I would like, but I feel it is ready to receive feedback and be used.  Just know there will be updates that may change things as development continues.\r\n\r\n[b]Requires:[/b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904920097]Fancy Handwork[/url]\r\nFancy Handwork is required as it fixes many of the animations for holding weapons, adds a modifier key, and I use its functions to syncronize the animation state locally and over multiplayer.\r\n\r\n[h2]Features[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Equipped Melee Weapons in your Secondary Hand can now attack!\r\n[*]Offhand attack speed is calculated similarly to vanilla, including injuries skills, etc.\r\n[*]Damage Calculation is mostly vanilla (see more about this below), so skills and other factors WILL impact damage!\r\n[*]TRUE Dual-Wielding Melee Weapons! Automatically alternate your attacks (Configurable in Sandbox).\r\n[*]Unarmed Attacks! Punch those Zombies!\r\n[*]Offhand Attacks [b]WILL[/b] collide with the environment!  Break that Window!\r\n[*]Compatible with ALL weapon mods!\r\n[*]Calls ALL relevant Events during an attack, for compatibility with mods that use these Events!\r\n[*]Your ability to shove is still available!\r\n[*]Works with Controllers!\r\n[*]FULLY compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915572347]The Only Cure but better[/url] by Pao. Keep the ability to attack without your Right Arm!\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]How to Use[/h2]\r\nActions for Brutal Handwork will require the Fancy Handwork Modifier Key. By default, the Modifier Key is:\r\n\r\n[b]Keyboard: Left Control[/b] - This can be changed in the Options\r\n[b]NOTE: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND[/b] that you either remove or change the default \"Aim\" binding on Left Control, or change the Fancy Handwork Modifier Key (preferably remove Aim).  They can use the same key, but it may be annoying when further actions are added.  In my opinion, using Control for \"Aim\" is not a good use for the key, and I will always Right-Click.  As such, Fancy Handwork and Brutal Handwork are intended to replace this key with real functionality.  I do not change this by default to not cause sudden changes to play styles, but highly recommend this.\r\n\r\n[b]Controller: Left Bumper[/b] -- Cannot be changed\r\n\r\nMoving forward, I will refer to the \"Modifier Key\" as just the \"Modifier\".\r\n\r\nSimply equip an item in your left hand, and you're good to go!\r\n[list]\r\n[*]If only a secondary weapon is equipped, your player will automatically attack with the offhand.\r\n[*]If you have both a primary and secondary weapon, then you must use the Modifier while aiming to attack with your offhand. Alternatively, enable the Sandbox option to automatically switch between main and offhand attacks!\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h3]Unarmed attacks[/h3]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]When unarmed, hold the Modifier while aiming to raise your fists, and press attack.  Available in the Sandbox options is a control to always raise your fists when unarmed and aiming!\r\n[*]Unarmed currently does small bits of damage, but can be used well enough to fend off a few zombies if you're careful.  I have plans to expand this into its own \"weapon\" skill, allow for unarmed weapons, and more.  For now, these do a small amount damage but are affected by your current Strength and Fitness traits.\r\n[*]Unarmed has no real side-effects, in that you can punch windows and doors no problem.  I plan on expanding this much further, and would like to have the unarmed be affected by your gloves as well as open this up to unarmed weapons.\r\n[*]Unarmed can be disabled in the Sandbox Options.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2934621024/3776868105337524453/]Current Limitations and Bugs are found here![/url][/h2]\r\n\r\n[h2]Future Plans[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]First and foremost, I would like to get my damage calculation functions to work over multiplayer.  I have a plan, but need some time to get things done/test/etc. However, for now I need a small break from this and just wanted to release what I have. When this is done, I can give almost full control for combat in the Sandbox options.\r\n[*]Next will be Dual Wielding handguns.  My damage functions will be critical in making this work properly, as they should handle ranged damage already.\r\n[*]I also would like to port the rest of the melee attack variations to be an offhand attack, and overall improve the quality of the animations.\r\n[*]Add progression to combat, so you feel more powerful overtime. For example, at level 1 you have -1 multihit, and at level 10 you have +1 multihit on all weapons, etc.\r\n[*]Add new systems to combat such as: quick throwables, on-demand heavy attacks at the cost of additional stamina, attack combos, possibly charged ranged attacks, etc.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Compatibility[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Should be compatible with ALL weapon mods\r\n[*]Likely not compatible with other offhand attack mods, but this is done very differently so maybe? I wouldn't, its untested and unecessary. Just don't.\r\n[*]Mods that modify the AttackHook are not compatible.\r\n[*]Mods that use the various Weapon Events will be triggered correctly for offhand attacks.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nSource: [url=https://github.com/hlfstr/pz-mods]GitHub[/url]\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2934621024\r\nMod ID: BrutalHandwork",

    "description": "[h1]Do you enjoy building in games?[/h1]\r\n[b]I absolutely do![/b]\r\nHowever, I feel that building in Project Zomboid isn't the game's strongest suit at the moment. In my survival experiences, I often found myself constructing square-shaped houses with just one entrance and a few windows, which looked downright dreadful. Now that I've familiarized myself with the map editor, I can finally bring to life what I've longed to see on the Workshop \u2013 a small, modest cottage nestled in a convenient location, ready to be adorned to my heart's content.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h2]What awaits you on the map?[/h2]\r\nEach of the houses comes equipped with light switches and rooms, but their final appearance is up to you.\r\n\r\n[h2]Map Features[/h2]\r\nOn the map, you'll find a convenient lake, perfect for fishing and replenishing water supplies. Surrounding forests provide protection against zombies and opportunities for gathering construction resources. Additionally, resource gathering zones are fully configured, making this place ideal for building a base and surviving.\r\n\r\n[h2][b]Build It![/b][/h2]\r\nThis isn't just another dull house you subscribe to and forget about \u2013 it's a kind of mini base-building quest that adds purpose to your search for furniture and resources.\r\n\r\n[b]Build a base, Gather resources, Defend against zombies, Have fun![/b]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\nCoordinates: [spoiler] 25x36 | 25x37[/spoiler]\r\n[h3]Resource Gathering Zones:[/h3]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/kqJc2Et.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h3]Map:[/h3]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/cptaipw.png[/img]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h2]Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)[/h2]\r\n\r\n[b]q: Why do I see question marks on some tiles?[/b]\r\na: They appear due to the \"-debug\" mode being enabled in the game's launch options. You can right-click on these tiles and press \"Remove\" if you don't want to disable debug mode.\r\n\r\n[b]q: Can I add the map to an existing world?[/b]\r\na: Yes, you can, but only if you haven't visited this location in the game before installing the mod.\r\n\r\n[b]q: Why doesn't the map appear in my game world?[/b]\r\na: You may not have configured the map order in the sandbox settings. Make sure the \"Muldraugh, KY\" map is at the bottom of the list.\r\n\r\n[b]q: Is this map compatible with ....?[/b]\r\na: I'm not sure. If you know of any mods conflicting with this map, feel free to report it in the discussions below.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZHVwY3UxNGNjaDdqMjRscDhxdW5ha2VtdHo4Y3l3NTQ0b2RudDFicSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Y1l5QeXh0KHRkeDke3/giphy.gif[/img]\r\nIf you liked the mod, you can buy me coffee here:\r\n[url=https://boosty.to/hardgridus][img]https://i.imgur.com/vUaRQJ1.png[/img][/url]\r\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/hardgridus][img]https://i.imgur.com/FL5APxv.jpeg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 3159054833\r\nMod ID: BuildIt\r\nMap Folder: BuildItCell1\r\nMap Folder: BuildItCell2",

There isn't anything I can do about how the other map authors treat their roads. So for now, you'll want to move/destroy those road blocks on the edge of Coryerdon, and clear out some trees and maybe even lay concrete down on the edge of Over the River. If you choose Dirkerdam instead of Coryerdon, it's a clean seamless connection.\r\n\r\nI chose not to overwrite the adjoining cell of Over the River or Coryerdon as this would require a specific map load order to line everything up, and that would surely cause confusion, not to mention I didn't feel comfortable with overlaying my work onto someone else's.\r\n\r\n[h1]Huge ass thanks to Daddy Dirkie Dirk[/h1]\r\n...his videos were absolutely critical in learning how to pull all this off, thanks dude.

    "description": "[hr][/hr][h1]Craft Spare Engine Parts yourself![/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the magazine \"[i]The Machinist[/i]\". Find it and read it! This adds [u]three different recipes[/u] for making spare engine parts. Alternatively, you can unlock them by reaching a certain level in each required skill without ever reading the magazine (B42+ only).\r\n[olist]\r\n[*]Needs metal working skill and more metal parts\r\n[*]Needs mechanics skill and some additional uncommon parts\r\n[*]Needs electronics skill and additional electronic parts\r\n[/olist]\r\nIt can be used for single player but the true reason I created this is multiplayer. Because often vehicles of entire towns are stripped of their engines to get these juicy spare parts, and this mod is meant to help with exactly this issue.\r\n\r\n[h3]Version and language support[/h3]\r\nThis mod is compatible with B41 & B42. It is safe to add or remove in existing games. In version 1.3 English, German, Russian, French, Spanish (ES and AR), Traditional Chinese, Hungarian, Italian, Dutch, Polish, and Portuguese (PTBR) are supported, but on player requests and with a little help I will definitely add more.\r\n\r\n[h3]Future of the mod[/h3]\r\nAs B42 progresses, crafting is expected to get a great revamp, and a lot more recipes and items will be added. In response to this, the recipes in this mod will likely be changed in the future to better match B42's new crafting system.\r\n\r\n[h3]Reuploading and modpacks[/h3]\r\nFor server owners it can be very useful to have their own modpack. That's why I allow reuploads of my mod as part of a modpack for a server if credit is given and if the modpack is unlisted on steam and only shared with the server members. Under all other circumstances please abstain from reoploads.\r\n\r\n[h1]Important: balancing settings[/h1]\r\n\r\nWhen installing the mod, it comes as four separate ones named \"expensive - original\", \"moderate\", \"cheap\", and \"cheapest\". These four mods all do basically the same, but the cost, results, and requirements of the crafting recipes are hugely different as can be seen in the images above. This allows you to choose a difficulty, how much impact you want this mod to have on your gameplay, and how much you would like to spare those poor car engines from looting.\r\nOnly choose and activate one of the four mods. If more are activated, it won't break the game, but it will cause a recipe redundancy.\r\n\r\nI chose to implement difficulty / balancing settings this way and not via actual options within a single mod in order to prevent the need to add the ModOptions mod as a dependency. I have done this to avoid breaking people's save games and servers which already used the CEP mod before Version 1.2 and haven't got the ModOptions mod.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr][i]Workshop ID: 2744114761\r\nMod ID: CraftEngineParts / CraftEnginePartsModerate / CraftEnginePartsCheap / CraftEnginePartsCheapest\r\n\r\n[u]Also check  out:[/u] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3401280772]Simple Rolling Papers[/url] [/i]",

    "description": "[h1]Overview :[/h1]\r\nThere may be multiple patterns of furniture overlay graphics, but the patterns are defined per coordinate, not per item. Therefore, when you bring furniture back to your base and place it there, you may see a different graphic than the first time you picked it up. This mod solves that problem and allows free selection of overlay graphics for furniture. And for world-placed items other than Moveable, the placement position can be adjusted.\r\n[b][i]Confirmed to work with Build 41/42.[/i][/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]Features - 1.Change Furniture Display :[/h1]\r\nYou can change the overlay graphic freely by following the steps below.\r\n\r\n[img]https://imgur.com/KxT9P0m.png[/img]\r\n(1) Execute \"Change furniture display\" from the item or world context menu.\r\n\r\n[img]https://imgur.com/RHS8pQg.png[/img]\r\n(2) You can select the graphics to display from the configuration window.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Press the \"Select\" button below the graphic you want to display.\r\n[*]The currently selected graphic will be marked with a red circle icon in the upper right corner.\r\n[*]\"Default\" will return to the original display mode. In this setting, the graphics displayed will change depending on the coordinates of the placement.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Features - 2.Adjust Item Position :[/h1]\r\nYou can adjust the placed item position by following the steps below.\r\n\r\n[img]https://imgur.com/0oqM9m5.png[/img]\r\n(1) Execute \"Adjust item position\" from the world item context menu.\r\n\r\n[img]https://imgur.com/SHLOYDw.png[/img]\r\n(2) You can change the item positions and rotations from the adjust position window.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]\"--\" button : Decrease value a lot.\r\n[*]\"-\" button : Decrease value a little.\r\n[*]\"C\" button : Clear value to zero.\r\n[*]\"+\" button : Increase value a little.\r\n[*]\"++\" button : Increase value a lot.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Options :[/h1]\r\nThese options are available in Sandbox Options.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Meta > Enable Adjust Item Position : Enables Adjust Item Position.

Please request the mod name.\r\n\r\n[*][h2]How do I do a piece of large furniture that has been divided?[/h2]\r\nYou can select graphics in each divided part.\r\n\r\n[*][h2]What happens if I rotate the furniture?[/h2]\r\nIf the furniture is rotated, it will be processed as a different item. Therefore, please select the graphics for each direction. However, if the same direction is made again, the previous selection is kept.\r\n\r\n[*][h2]Already I have been selected, but before I know it, it's back to the default display..?[/h2]\r\nIt may have reverted to the default display for an unknown reason.

In this case, the graphics will not be restored unless it is manually changed again.\r\n[*]The menu of sinks does not appear in the world context menu. However, this is due to the vanilla implementation and cannot be resolved at this time. If you wish to change the display of a sink, please pick it up once and then execute the change process from the item context menu.\r\n[*]If an item is removed from a square that contains an item whose height (Z) has been changed by the Item Adjust Position feature, the height of other items in the same square will be restored.

I don't think I got every single effect that could be listed, and I may have made a mistake somewhere, so I'm relying on you guys for that.\r\n\r\nThis mod was made so it can easily be supported by other Skill mods, as well as dynamic trait mods.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Crafting recipes requiring Skills[/h1]\r\nCrafting recipes unlocked from one (or two) skills are dynamically added to each skill level tooltip.\r\nThis means that crafting recipes from mods (such as Scrap Weapons for example) will also show up on the tooltip.\r\nCrafting recipes requiring 3 or more different skills will not show up.\r\nAlso, only 10 recipes per tooltip will show up.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Buildable constructions requiring Skills[/h1]\r\nDue to how messy the building system is, only vanilla constructions are displayed in the tooltips. Modded constructions (such as More Builds mod for example) will not be displayed.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Foraging stats & info[/h1]\r\nFor the Foraging skill, the information of what each level unlocks is taken directly from the foraging system of the game, which means it will account for potential additions or tweaks from mods (such as Soul Fisher's Foraging time for example).\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Fishing stats[/h1]\r\nFor the Fishing skill, the fishing stats are calculated with the chosen Nature Abundance as well as the current time of day and current season.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Future plans[/h1]\r\nSupport for more modded skills.\r\nCurrently working on : Driving Skill , Artillery Skill, Hunting Skill.\r\nWill next work on : Lockpicking skill , Archery skill.

    "description": "[h1]Say goodbye to worm furrows.[/h1]\r\nWorms in Project Zomboid are versatile little fellows. You can use them as bait in fishing, in trapping, you can even eat them if you're desperate; they never perish, and they don't require crawling around \"foraging\" with crippled view cone, exposing yourself to a sudden bite from behind.\r\nHowever, what they do require... is digging.\r\nHow many times did you dig furrows purely to get some worms? How many times have you been wondering why there's no \"Remove furrow\" cursor, and gone ahead removing them one by one via context menu?\r\nIf the answer is \"one time too many\", then this mod is for you.\r\n\r\n[h1]What does it do exactly?[/h1]\r\nIt adds a new context menu option: \"Dig Worms\". Once you select it, your character will dig the same patch of ground until you decide you have enough worms (or until a stray zombie gnaws on their neck from behind). Zero unneeded furrows will be produced. Only worms and exhaustion.\r\nYou will need a shovel though, or anything that digs.\r\n\r\n[h1]But is it balanced?[/h1]\r\nSee for yourself:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]One iteration of worm digging takes exactly as long as digging furrow and removing it would.\r\n[*]Calorie consumption is unchanged.\r\n[*]Exhaustion is unchanged.\r\n[*]Chance to get a worm per digging iteration is [strike]unchanged[/strike] [b]slightly increased[/b] when it's raining (because it makes sense).\r\n[/list]\r\nOne thing that's gone is monotonous button pressing. You're welcome.\r\n\r\n[h1]Still not convinced?[/h1]\r\nYou can keep digging worms the old-fashioned way - but that doesn't mean I can't help you. This mod also adds a \"Remove furrow\" cursor.\r\nFrom now on, \"Remove\" function, apart from just removing a furrow, produces a cursor that you can use to quickly remove furrows you don't need.\r\n\r\n[h1]Translations[/h1]\r\nThis mod is AI-translated to all available languages. I don\u2019t have the ability to comprehend the quality of translation - but if you see that things don\u2019t look right on your language, I\u2019d appreciate your contribution.\r\n\r\n[h1]Special thanks[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Tchernobill - his \"Auto\" series was an inspiration for this mod.\r\n[*]Poltergeist - for his amazing auto translation tool that I believe every PZ modder should use.\r\n[*]Burryaga - for his numerous advice and thorough code review. Modders together strong.\r\n[*]You - if you like, subscribe and/or favorite this mod.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Like this?[/h1]\r\nTry my other mod - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3175536048]To-Do List[/url]!

Lowered the skill requirements slightly and roughly doubled the condition increase for the number of parts needed.\n\n\nGives the player the ability to repair the lightbar if a vehicle has one.\n\nHow to repair a lightbar:\n\n1. Raise your Electrical skill to the level listed in the tool tip. This will vary by vehicle type and will be one level below what is required for the Mechanics skill to work on the engine, or level 5, whichever is less. If the current condition of the lightbar is 0%, this requirement will be increased by one level of the Electrical skill (but capped at level 6).\n2. Collect the needed parts to repair in your inventory. This includes Electronics Scrap, and Electric Wire. If the current condition of the lightbar is 0%, you will also need two (plain, without a named color) Light Bulbs and one Amplifier.\n3. Open the Vehicle Mechanics menu and right-click on the Lightbar in the parts list.\n4. Click on the \"Repair\" option in the context menu.\n\nThe lightbar's condition will be increased according to how many Spare Electrical Parts and Wire you have in your inventory. Currently this is set to a 10% condition increase for every 5 Electronics Scrap and 1 Electric Wire.\n\nWritten for and tested only in Project Zomboid version 41.53.

    "description": "[h3][b]FEATURES HIGHLIGHT - ALL FEATURES ARE OPTIONAL![/b][/h3]\r\n\u2605 Tweak impact of damage on trunks' capacity - prevent capacity reduction, slow it down or speed it up!\r\n\u2605 Adjust capacity of trunks for all cars (both modded and vanilla (with exceptions listed in Compatibility section)) - choose [b][i]Eggon's Capacity Balance[/i][/b] and/or use multiplier to further modify capacities accross the board!\r\n\u2605 Balance cars' loudness according to their size (type has an effect too) from lowest (Chavalier Dart) to highest (Chevalier Step Van & Chevalier Cosette).\r\n\u2605 Balance cars' engine force to make things more interesting\r\n\r\n- everything is available through Sandbox Settings.\r\n[h3][b]TWEAKING DAMAGE EFFECT ON CAPACITY[/b][/h3]\r\nAdjust the value of [b][i]Capacity loss rate multiplier[/i][/b] setting to change the effect of damage on trunks' capacities. You can set the multiplier to:\r\n1) Zero - to block capacity reduction (DEFAULT)\r\n2) Number between 0 and 1 - to proportionally slow down capacity loss.\r\n3) 1 - to keep the vanilla rate.\r\n4) Number above 1 to proportionally increase capacity loss.\r\n[h3][b]EGGON'S CAPACITY BALANCE[/b][/h3]\r\nThis setting will change the trunk sizes proportionally to car size ranging from 25 (Chavalier Dart) to 300 (Chevalier Step Van) for the vanilla cars. See one of the Steam page slides to find capacities of all vanilla cars. For large trucks from different mods capacity might be even higher.\r\n[h3][b]CUSTOM CAPACITIES TWEAKING[/b][/h3]\r\nAdjust the value of [b][i]Capacity multiplier[/i][/b] setting to further change the capacities of ALL trunks. The adjustment will be applied on top of vanilla trunk sizes or on top of [b][i]Eggon's Capacity Balance[/i][/b] if you selected it. Multiplier of value 1 means no change is applied. Value below 1 means proportionally smaller trunks, value above 1 - proportionally larger.\r\n[h3][b]EGGON'S LOUDNESS BALANCE[/b][/h3]\r\nThis setting modifies cars' loudness proportionally to their size. The larger the car, the louder it will be. Sports cars, such as Chevalier Cosette will be loud too. See the relative loudness of cars on one of Steam page's slides.\r\n\r\nRange of cars' loudness is the same as in vanilla, however it is allocated differently to various cars. Some cars are louder, some more silent than in vanilla (most cars are slighlty more silent). Large trucks from other mods might be ca. 8% louder than the max vanilla level.\r\n[h3][b]EGGON'S ENGINE POWER BALANCE[/b][/h3]\r\nThis setting influences power of a few cars to add additional flavors. Pickups and some cars with light bars get more power, so will be better for towing and trailers. Station Wagons will get less, to offset theit excellent loudness to capacity ratio. They will be sluggish and you should avoid driving them offroad especially when having the \"Sunday Driver\" trait.\r\n[h3][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/h3]\r\nEWC 2.0 should be compatible with all modded cars! (unless someone did something really crazy ;) ) In particular this means that [b]all modded cars[/b] will be impacted by [b][i]Capacity Multiplier[/i][/b] and [b][i]Capacity Loss Multiplier[/i][/b]. Also there should be no more clashes with mods modifying vehicle files (like [b][i]Refrigerated Spiffo Van[/i][/b] and [b][i]Vanilla Vehicle Enhancer[/i][/b]), because EWC 2.0 does not modify these files.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you decide to choose [b][i]Eggon's Balance[/i][/b] the configuration of the cars for this balance might not be yet implemented, because there are LOTS of modded cars. I will do my best to add the configurations for at least a few most popular mods. It will also be possible to make plugins to EWC 2.0 to create your own balances for any cars and/or cover mods not covered by me.\r\n\r\nConfirmed compatible mods:\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1896907770]Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars[/url] - compatible - full balance is added!\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/KI5/myworkshopfiles/?appid=108600]KI5's cars[/url] - compatible, full balance is added.\r\n- [b]Shark and Cytt Kentucky Car Overhaul[/b] - compatible (based on a few tested cars). As it overwrites vanilla cars, Eggon's Balances for vanilla cars can be applied.\r\n- [b]fhqwhgads vehicles[/b] - compatible (based on a few tested cars). No balance is provided.\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2281256511]Paint Your Ride[/url] - compatible\r\n- [b]Autotsar's Trailers[/b] - compatible No balance is provided.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you identify any compatibility issues and if you can confirm other mods that you use to be compatible - I'll add them to the list.\r\n[h3][b]PLUGINS TO EWC 2.0 FROM OTHER CREATORS[/b][/h3]\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2846495827]Trunk Capacity Bonus Addon[/url] by UdderlyEvelyn\r\n[h3][b]SWITCHING FROM EWC to EWC 2.0[/b][/h3]\r\nTo switch from original [b][i]Eggon's Worthwhile Cars[/i][/b] mod to the [b][i]2.0[/i][/b] version just remove [b][i]EWC[/i][/b] and add [b][i]EWC 2.0[/i][/b] with support mods to your savegame!\r\n[h3][b]EXISTING SAVES AND MULTIPLAYER[/b][/h3]\r\nThe mod should work with existing saves. All new values should be immediatelly applied. I expect the mod to work on MP. The mod will be added to a savegame with default settings. See below for limitations on changing the settings in an existing game.\r\n[h3][b]CHANGING SANDBOX SETTINGS MID GAME[/b][/h3]\r\nAfter settings are changed, game needs to be reloaded. Changes to capacity and loudness should get applied after reload. Turning off [b][i]Eggon's Engine Force Balance[/i][/b] will not work for cars already interacted with. Therefore if you're planning to turn it off after adding EWC 2.0 to your savegame, do so when not standing next to a car. This way you will prevent this balance from being applied.\r\n[h3][b]REPORTING BUGS / KNOWN ISSUES[/b][/h3]\r\nAdditional trunks attached to cars (eg. roof racks) and or non-standard trunks of modded cars might display unmodified capacity in the mechanics menu. They should displayed correct, modified capacity in the loot menu.\r\n\r\nPlease post any other bug reports [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2841030649/3459345750020191245/]here[/url].\r\n[h3][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/h3]\r\nTwo support mods are required:\r\n1) My support mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2617575303]Eggon's Modding Utils[/url] and\r\n2) [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1430463738]Vehicle Tweaker API[/url] - by [b][i]soulfilcher[/i][/b]\r\n[h3][b]HOW IS THE MOD DIFFERENT THAN THE ORIGINAL EGGON'S WORTHWHILE CARS?[/b][/h3]\r\nEWC was my first mod, I knew nothing about modding PZ. The design therefore was simple and not without drawbacks. EWC 2.0 comes to address those issues:\r\n1) All features are now optional\r\n2) Capacities and capacity loss rate can be now smoothly adjusted\r\n3) Cars created by other modders can be adjusted too\r\n4) There should be no more compatibility issues with car mods\r\n5) EWC 2.0 should be much less prone to issues resulting with PZ updates changing desing of vehicles.\r\n[h3][b]SUPPORT ME[/b][/h3]\r\nIf you appreciate my content and want to encourage me to deliver more... consider supporting me on Ko-Fi or Patreon!

Elliot Pond is a community that combines the hospitality of a small town with the services of a larger, urban centre. The pristine wilderness and thousands of lakes that surround the area provide residents and visitors with many opportunities for hiking, camping and fishing.\r\n\r\nYou will find everything that you could ever need/want during a zombie outbreak in this map from nice and quiet  suburbs, a robust and varied shopping district, as well as decent industrial zones. \r\n\r\n\r\nOver 300 Buildings all of which are custom built and decorated for you to explore, and survive in. \r\n\r\nThis map is compatible with the current versions of Eerie County, and Raven Creek. Anything else down in that area i'am not 100% sure about as i haven't tested every map out there. If there are compatibility issues please let me know and ill see what i can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry about all the tile requirements i kinda got excited and went overboard.

You'll be able to purge the majority of negative traits and earn a lot of positive ones (but also earn some negative ones as well). This would help you to go from your average Joe to actual GigaChad in-game. You repair a lot of cars? You get better at it. You train yourself to take long-range kills with proper rifles? Why wouldn't it warranty getting Eagle-Eyed? You pick up thousands of plants through your lifetime and still can't call yourself Herbalist? Yea, that doesn't sound right to me. You maintain great sleeping schedule but for some reason you still need same amount of sleep as when you were sleeping whenever? Not anymore. Welcome to the Dynamic Traits World, ladies and gentlemen!\r\n\r\n[h1]Features[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][h3]NEW! UI with all the mod information in-game! Default hotkey is \"[\"\r\n[*]70+ dynamic traits (vanilla + added by the mod), full list on [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1405szVLTetMioT0P8ddvPUJTv6VyLtTEvWxyn0cuZjI/edit?usp=sharing]this spreadsheet[/url].\r\n[*][h3][b]FULL sandbox customization[/b]. Choose which perks you want to be dynamic, choose how fast you get them, choose how fast you lose them, customize anything with more than 150 sandbox options. Nothing is forced upon player, if you like 1% of the mod, you can literally set it up so you get to use that 1% and nothing else.[/h3]\r\n[*]Advanced systems that affect a lot of traits. Affinity system, that allows you to stick to your starting traits better. Delayed traits system, that allows you to get/remove traits with random delay.\r\n[*]QOL (Quality of Life) submod - mark all traits that are dynamic so in character creating you can see which perks are obtainable during gameplay! Can be enabled without enabling main mod, so if you don't like main features added by this mod and just want to see which traits are dynamic in your game with SOTO/MST/MT/DT - you can do that.\r\n[*]For new traits (aka not vanilla game), customization is also present. Want Hoarder perk to give you more carry weight per point of STR? Go adjust it in Sandbox. Want to be even happier under rain with Pluviophile? Sandbox it is.\r\n[*]Client-sided configuration available with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169435993]Mod Options[/url].\r\n[*]Don't like some/all traits added by this mod but only want to have vanilla traits dynamic?

    "description": "[h1]Supports B41. Works in Multiplayer[/h1]\r\n[h3]A new save is not required[/h3]\r\n[h1]A VERSION FOR B42 WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON.[/h1]\r\n[h3]There is currently a bug in B42 where Animation Sets are not recognized from the new B42 folder structure, and thus have to be duplicated which doubles size of a B42 mod. This is an issue unique to Animations. Once this is fixed by the developers (it's been reported), the B42 version will be made available.[/h3]\r\n[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlfstr/pz-mods/devel/like_fav.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nA Suite of Animations to make your player more alive!\r\n\r\n[h2]Features[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Attaching or Detaching an item to your Hotbar now has a chance to be done with the left arm\r\n[*] Equipping and Unequipping your secondary item is now done with the left arm\r\n[*] \"Hand Swap\" action to quickly swap the primary and secondary held items\r\n[*] Modifier key to quickly equip items in secondary hand using from your Hotbar\r\n[*] Animation Mask for the Left and Right Arms to correct the Positions and Rotation of the held item\r\n[*] Includes 2 new poses when aiming a handgun and holding a secondary tool, based on your \"Aim\" level!  Configurable in the Sandbox Options.\r\n[*] World Interaction animations!\r\n[*] [b]NEW:[/b] World Interaction animations from the rear!\r\n[*] Cooking Animations!\r\n[*] Appropriate Vanilla Animations have now been placed on [b]over 50![/b] TimedActions that previously did not have one.\r\n[*] [b]NEW:[/b] Wrench Repair Animation!\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Updates[/h2]\r\nImportant information is updated on this page, but full information and release notes are available in the Discussions.  Please see the latest: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2904920097/3762228679801751286/]Fancy Handwork - \"It's Over 9,000!\" Update[/url]\r\n\r\n[h2]IMPORTANT[/h2]\r\nIf you receive an error about missing actions, or world interactions are simply not playing, you may need to restart Project Zomboid.  I have noticed that enabling this mod for the first time on an already-existing save and starting the game will result in the new animations not being loaded until the game is restarted. This is a [b]BASE GAME[/b] issue, but should only happen the first time.\r\n\r\nIf you receive an error following any update, please see: [url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/42925-how-to-fix-updated-mods-in-build-41-multiplayer/]How to fix updated mods in Build 41 Multiplayer[/url]\r\nThis mod adds many additional animation and action files, which may change between releases.  I try to minimize this, but sometimes it is necessary.  Unfortunately, Steam sometimes doesn't like to update these correctly resulting in errors.\r\n\r\n[h2]Usage[/h2]\r\nWhen Attaching or Detaching an item on your Hotbar, you have a chance for the action to automatically be done with your left hand.\r\n\r\nA modifier key is added as well, which by default is bound to \"Left Control\".\r\n[b]Note:[/b] By default, \"Left Control\" is the \"Aim\" key.  I personally do not use the keyboard to aim (its right-click on the mouse anyways) so I disable this keybind.  You are free to rebind the key in options.\r\n\r\nWhen you press the Modifier Key and a Hotbar slot, the item slotted there will go into your Secondary Hand.  Example: (Left Control + 2) equips a Hammer to your left hand.\r\n\r\nPressing the Modifier and \"E\" will swap the items in your hands. (Configurable)\r\n\r\nInteracting with the world normally, such as opening and closing doors and curtains, flicking light switches, and more, all now have an Animation!\r\n\r\nAlmost ALL TimedActions now have an Animation!  No longer will your character just stand there, waiting for a progress bar to fill up!\r\n\r\n[h3]Notes about World Interactions[/h3]\r\nIf you are standing still you will turn and face the object you are interacting with if you are not already doing so. There is a Sandbox setting to control how long of a delay before you character is standing still, or the forced turn can be disabled or required.\r\n\r\nWhen performing a World Interaction and moving your character will slow down slightly, and stop altogether in the case of opening a Garage Door, for a very brief moment.  I have no plans on this being a configurable option, and this is done intentionally.  It is a fantastic inclusion for immersion in my opinion, and in tight situations makes planning your movement all the more important.  After time, you will hardly notice it.\r\n[b]NEW 01/19/2023[/b] - The speed reduction has been reduced from 50% to 25%.  This should help prevent the player from being trapped, while still being a nice addition to immersion.\r\n\r\n[h2]Multiplayer[/h2]\r\nAnimations should sync across multiplayer with little to no issues!\r\n\r\n[h2]Controllers[/h2]\r\nThere is currently no support for controllers, unless an action is done via the Context Menu. I will be working on Controller Support in a future Update.\r\n\r\n[h2]Compatibility[/h2]\r\nMouse Click World Interactions are not triggered from: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2795987309]Left Click Redux - Click To Act[/url]\r\nCompatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915572347]The Only Cure but better[/url].

    "description": "This mod will add several vehicles to the game. The vehicles are vanilla-styled (including lore-friendly names, or optional real names), era appropriate (1993 and earlier), and support all the features of vanilla vehicles. The pack will be a variety pack, aiming to add a little bit of everything to the game from everyday sedans, vans and SUVs to sports cars, with sports cars being much more rare than everyday machines.\r\n\r\nAll cars that are capable of it also support [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2281256511]Paint Your Ride[/url] in B41, or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3464606086]HDCP Immersive Vehicle Paint[/url] in B42!\r\n\r\n[h1]Also supports Build 42![/h1]\r\nThe ID is slightly different for B42 (finally fixed the typo in it), but the B41 version should still work fine\r\n[h1]!!//////////////////////Notes for B42\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\!![/h1]\r\n[list][*]The max vehicle texture size must be at least 1024 for now. The textures break if the game has to scale them down currently. [b]Texture compression does still work, and can be enabled if you need it[/b]\r\n[*]If the vehicle mechanics UI doesn't work, another mod in your list is likely breaking it. Mods that haven't updated to the new crafting system can break UI elements, and any mod that breaks the mechanics UI can also break other UI elements as well.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]If you were using my existing standalone vehicle mods, it is [b][u]safe (and best)[/u][/b] to switch to this mod.[/h1]\r\nThis mod contains the following vehicle mods of mine: Lancia Stratos, R32 Skyline, Supra, Fox Body, Kei Sports, LM002, 240SX Coupe, Diablo, 300ZX, GT40, Miata, Toyota X90s, and Reliant Robin Mk. II. Disable these mods and use this instead if you plan on using this mod, as they can cause issues when used together.\r\n\r\n[h1]You can choose which cars you would like to spawn naturally, from 3 selections of car lists[/h1]\r\n[b][u]If you want all cars to spawn, you don't need to enable the optional Spawn Selection sub-mods[/u][/b]\r\nTo choose which types of cars you'd like to have spawn, enable the Spawn Selection sub-mods of the cars you would like to allow to spawn in addition to the main mod. There are 3 lists to choose from, and you can select any combination of them: [list]\r\n[*][b]US Motors:[/b] This list contains cars that were available and sold in the US. Examples include the Bronco, Mustang, and 240SX.\r\n[*][b]Imports:[/b] This list contains cars that were not available and sold in the US, but common in other countries. Examples are the R32 Skyline, Toyota Mark II, and Reliant Robin\r\n[*][b]Rares and Exotics:[/b] This list contains cars that are either very expensive or produced in very low numbers. Examples are the GT40, Diablo, and Stratos. [/list]\r\nAlso note that the imports and exotics are both very rare in the base spawn lists, and the Spawn Selection sub-mods will not make them more common.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the mod has been translated to German thanks to Eaglefire. Check out their German Project Zomboid community [url=https://discord.gg/project-zomboid-de]here![/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]This mod pairs well with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793164190] Vehicle Spawn Zones Expanded. (B42 Update pending)[/url][/h1]\r\nSince the exotic and import cars are very rare, I started work on the spawn zones to give some specified areas for these cars to spawn, so there is a decent chance to find them on a save without it potentially becoming overwhelming. It eventually became more, adding a variety of new spawn areas beyond that. It works very well with this mod, and has many spawn lists for cars in this pack.\r\n\r\n[h1]Also check out these complimentary MZ-themed mods![/h1] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2895585037][img]https://i.imgur.com/POZK84w.png[/img][/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841969842][img]https://i.imgur.com/IrKA7bh.png[/img][/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2856740739][img]https://i.imgur.com/TixgJf8.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Q: Multiplayer compatible?[/b]\r\nA: [b][u]Yes![/u][/b] In general, all of my (and many of others') vehicles will be MP compatible unless stated otherwise.\r\n\r\n[b]Q: Can this be used with other vehicle mods?[/b]\r\nA: [b][u]Yes![/u][/b] It will work with other vehicle packs, and standalone vehicle mods. This mod was even made with use alongside mods like Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars in mind, and has its spawn chances based around it. It doesn't alter anything vanilla either, so anything that changes vanilla vehicles will also work!\r\n\r\n[b]Q: What are the vehicle IDs?[/b]\r\nA: I've set up a post in the discussions with each vehicle ID and some small information about each car, check it out if you need the IDs.\r\n\r\n[b]Q: How rare are the exotic/import cars?[/b]\r\nA: They are [i]very[/i] rare, exotics in particular will be difficult to find on default (low) and normal car spawn rates. Exotics and imports will mostly only spawn near high-end houses, or anywhere else you can find the Cossette and Lang 4000 in vanilla, at a lower spawn rate. Some Easter Egg cars will spawn in similar areas to the Easter Egg cars from Used Cars. For some more specific hints, [spoiler]Riverside has a very large amount of possible spawn zones, and the bar across from the junkyard contains only sports car spawns, so that is the best place to look.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[b]Q: Can this be added mid-save?[/b]\r\nA: [b][u]Yes![/u][/b] Vehicles will only spawn in areas you have not explored yet however, so if you or your server have been all over the map, you may have trouble finding the vehicles. I'd recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871002471]Udderly Vehicle Respawn[/url] if you want to use this on an existing save, it will allow new vehicles to spawn in explored areas the world.\r\n\r\n[b]Q: I'm having issues joining/starting a server in MP (File mismatch, or connection lost after starting)[/b]\r\nA: First, check AuthenticPeach's guide about these issues [url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/42925-how-to-fix-updated-mods-in-build-41-multiplayer/]here.[/url] For more info, check the first post of the \"Bug reports\" thread in discussions.\r\n\r\n[b]Q: Can you make (x)?[/b]\r\nA: If you're going to request a car, note that my main focus at the moment are cars that fit the game's time period (1993 and earlier). I do have cars outside of this timeframe on my list, but it may be a while before I get to them. I also already have quite a few on my list, so there's no guarantee I'll get to all of them.\r\n\r\n[b]Q: What about animations?[/b]\r\nA: Animations are planned to officially come to vanilla vehicles, so they are planned for this pack as well. While I will redo some cars before TIS' animations are officially available, they will be released as separate mods for the time being with options to replace the ones in the pack, due to some features not working with animated parts. I'm still going to add vehicles in the current vanilla style to the pack, better set up for the upcoming animations.\r\n\r\n[url=https://discord.gg/hMqVf47TXA][img]https://i.imgur.com/fjDnNYl.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nB41 Mod IDs:\r\nfhqMotoriusZone\r\nfhqMotoriusZoneRealNames\r\nfhqMotoriusZoneUSDM\r\nfhqMotoriusZoneImports\r\nfhqMotoriusZoneExotics\n\nWorkshop ID: 2791656602\nMod ID: fhqMotoriousZone\nMod ID: fhqMotoriousZoneImports\nMod ID: fhqMotoriousZoneExotics\nMod ID: fhqMotoriousZoneRealNames\nMod ID: fhqMotoriousZoneUSDM",

    "description": "[h2]Contents[/h2]\r\nFirst Aid VHS Tapes\r\nAdds 4 VHS tapes that can be found in VHS stores.\r\n\r\nEach VHS tape teaches the player how to treat a different type of injury.\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Episode 1 \u2013 Lacerations\r\n[*] Episode 2 \u2013 Deep wounds\r\n[*] Episode 3 \u2013 Bone Fractures\r\n[*] Episode 4 \u2013 Burns\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nWatching these VHS tapes will also increase the First Aid skill.\r\n\r\n[img] https://i.imgur.com/vMWWflp.png [/img]\r\n\r\n[h2]Background[/h2]\r\nNot sure about you, but I\u2019ve always felt that the first aid skill was too difficult to increase naturally. Whilst I am aware you can simply roll around in glass shards and treat the wounds as they appear to help boost the first aid skill, it doesn\u2019t seem very immersive... Would you do such a thing in real life to learn first aid?\r\n\r\nWhile there [i]is[/i] an official in-universe way of learning first aid, you need to find 2, hard to find \u2018Home VHS\u2019 and I\u2019ve never found them in all my time playing! There is also no official, in-game way of teaching the player how to treat specific wounds. For example, crafting a splint to help fix a fracture, I only found out you could craft one by looking at the wiki\u2026\r\n\r\nWith that said, I decided to make this mod. Something that, with a bit of searching, allows the player to advance the first aid skill whilst learning the correct medical procedure on how to treat the injuries. (The procedures being the one found on the \"First Aid\" page of the PZ Wiki)\r\n\r\nI designed this mod to fit in with the other skill boosting VHS tapes such as Woodcraft and Exposure Survival. I would also consider this mod lore-friendly.\r\n\r\n[h2]Translation Credits[/h2]\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] SharleBu - Spanish\r\n[*] Stryker - Polish\r\n[*] Sknurt - Portuguese Brazilian\r\n[*] t3qquq - Korean\r\n[*] Degeneroach15 - Russian\r\n[*] Suzue - Japanese\r\n[*] Tast\u00e6 Good - Italian\r\n[*] Vael de Lyis - French\r\n[*] Ufzat - Turkish\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Supported Mods[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2732294885] Named skill VHS tapes [/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Other[/h2]\r\nTranslation requests or updates \u2013 see Translation Requests discussion.\r\nAny bugs? \u2013 see Bugs discussion.\r\n\r\nDo not reupload to steam or any other third party websites.\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 3153010942\r\nMod ID: FirstAidVHSTapes",

    "description": "[h1]Fix Inventory Tooltip lag[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod fixes a performance issue in the game that causes it to freeze up for a period of time, most commonly whenever you rip up clothing.\r\n\r\nThe problem becomes exponentially worse with the more clothing item mods you have, hence why it's the primary culprit.\r\n\r\nThe code is a classic example of \"accidentally quadratic\" If you care about the details, read on. If not, just download it.\r\n\r\n[h2]What the vanilla game does that causes this problem[/h2]\r\n\r\nThe game wants to show you a tooltip of the top 10 items that are valid for a given recipe, so it:\r\n\r\n1. Builds a complete list of all valid items, in no particular order.\r\n\r\n2. Sorts this complete list to move all items you actually have to the top - [i]O(n)[/i] complexity.\r\n\r\n3. Removes any items that are considered duplicates by virtue of being applicable to different slots (e.g. Left/right handed wristwatch) - [i]O(n^2)[/i] complexity!\r\n\r\n4. Renders the top 10 items of the list, ignoring anything else.\r\n\r\nThis is wasteful because it processes the full list of items, even though we only care about the top 10.\r\n\r\n[h2] What this mod makes it do [/h2]\r\n\r\n1. We build a complete list of valid items, but any items that exist in your inventory are sent to the start of the list, [b]at the point of insertion[/b].\r\n\r\n2. The list is truncated to the first 10 items and only these are sorted. We store the original length of the list for later - [i]O(1)[/i] complexity.\r\n\r\n3. Deduplication occurs as in vanilla, but, again, the list is now only 10 items long - [i]O(1)[/i] complexity.\r\n\r\n4. We render the list again. If there were more than 10 items, we ensure that the \"and X more\" text is computed correctly from the pre-truncation list size.\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2915430406\r\nMod ID: FixTooltipLag",

The whole system is not not new or made up by me but the usual evolved recipe(Stir Fry, Pie, Soup etc etc). Only difference is that in my version you need to craft the initial item from the food itself - there is no other item involved. Now you can click on that new item and start adding more meat to it, until its full and then cook it over the fire.\r\n[/list]\r\n[/code] \r\n\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]Brewing details :[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Brew Ethanol from potatoes/corn and yeast.  \r\n[*]Brew Vinegar from ethanol and vegetables.\r\n[*]Brewing and canning equipment such as wooden barrels and can sealers can be either looted or crafted.\r\n[*]Just make a brew and place the barrel on the ground and leave it be.\r\n[*]Ethanol takes 15 days to get ready.\r\n[*]Vinegar takes 10 days to get ready.\r\n[*]When the brew is ready, you can open the barrel while holding 5 empty bottles and voilaa - you get 5 bottles of ethanol/vinegar and your barrel can be used for the next brew.\r\n[*]Ethanol+Water can be mixed into vodka.\r\n[*]Ethanol can be also used as fuel.\r\n[*]You can use the vodka as a drink or to disinfect stuff.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Other :[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Sweet Juice can be stomped out of certain veggies and used as sugar - it also produces yeast as a by product.\r\n[*]Mushrooms can be stomped straight to yeast.\r\n[*]Cook tallow from any animal meat.\r\n[*]Make candles from tallow.

    "description": "[h1]EXCITING NEWS![/h1]\r\nThe latest blog post by The Indie Stone (https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2023/11/one-door-openz/) seems to hint that they will add a fuel-side indicator to the vanilla game on Build 42. \r\nI'm so happy that the developers noticed this small UI/UX tweak enough to warrant it to be in the base game. It has always been my intention to make this mod in the hopes of getting it implemented in vanilla.\r\nCheers to all who have supported this mod and I'm sure it will still come handy until B42 comes out.\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\nThis mod still works even though it's been over a year since I updated it. Works for Build 41.78+\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1] Build 41.68 Patch [/h1]\r\n- Fixed error with Agrotsar Tractor*\r\n- Fixed compatibility with two-wheeled vehicles**\r\n\r\n**For some bikes, the mod makers made it so that you could refuel on both sides, in this case I have disabled the indicator.\r\n*You may also find that the indicator does not appear in certain vehicles, this is because the mod makers have done some weird stuff on their vehicles that hinders this mod to get info on the gas tank location. One example of this is the Agrotsar Tractor that does not have a gas tank area which this mod relies on. \r\n\r\n[b]This mod should be loaded LAST. Specifically, after enabling other vehicle mods.[/b]\r\nFor server owners, place FSI at the end of the list of mods or after other vehicle mods. \r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1] Description [/h1]\r\n\r\nFind it annoying to turn your vehicle around in a gas station and attracting MORE zombies? Do you wish there was a way to know which side your car's gas tank is at? \r\n\r\n[i]Fuel Side Indicator[/i] is a simple addition to your vehicle's dashboard that lets you know which side you have to park your car when refuelling!\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1] Author's Notes [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis is my first UI mod! Please be patient with any bugs you may encounter and report them in the comments below.\r\n\r\n- No need for a new save, just enable it and you're ready\r\n- To disable, just disable the mod itself\r\n\r\nBig thanks to the PZ discord modding community! Special shout out to Shurutsue as well!\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY: Build 41.78+\r\n*Compatible with ALL vehicle mods! (as long as the vehicle has wheels)\r\n*If you have a mod that tweaks the vehicle dashboard, this mod [i]may[/i] conflict with it but not likely if it's a minor tweak.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLAYER COMPATIBILITY: \r\n* This should work since this is a client-side mod. Let me know down in the comments if you have trouble with the mod on your server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPACKING is ALLOWED. \r\nJust credit me and don't whine at me when something breaks when you repack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/photoshoplol][img]https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c14e387dab576fe667689cf/61e11d430afb112ea33c3aa5_Button-1-p-800.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2616986064\r\nMod ID: fuelsideindicator",

    "description": "[b][h3]New Extractor Hoods in B42![/h3][/b]\r\nBuild them in a square where you place your generator to extract the fumes from it out of the building. All automatically, but the hood will not start until power is there and will not extract unless a running generator is under the hood in the same square.\r\n\r\n[h3]Popcorn Machines:[/h3] They now have function and will convert instant popcorn packets and Sapph's corn kernels into edible popcorn without the pain of burning the food. Popcorn buckets are also added and you can butter the popcorn when in a bucket.\r\n\r\n[h3]Hotdog Machines:[/h3] They also have function and will keep from burning those priceless sausages. It uses the base sausages and sliced bread in the game to make hotdogs. If you have Sapph's Cooking mod installed you can also use the sausages and hotdog buns from that mod as well.\r\n\r\n[h3]Soda Fountains:[/h3] Are now plumbed objects and will dispense water for all the uses. It also dispenses soda to fountain cups and refills soda/water bottles for preserved use. They use soda syrups and CO2 tanks to operate. Just drop them into the counter the table top unit is on or put them inside the Slurp 'n Burp stand alone unit. These can now pull materials from any static container in the square or the square behind them. If water is a problem, try using water jugs from the Water Dispenser mod or plumb it like a sink.\r\n\r\n[h3]Bar Taps and Kegs:[/h3] Setup the kegs in furniture containers with the taps connected and you can pour them into red cups, beer mugs, and refill bottles. Kegs pulled from any static container in the square with the bar taps. Compatible with More Brews and More Brews kegs now spawn in bar tap counters in 2.0!\r\n\r\n[h3]Food Display Counters, Buffet Islands, Rounded Glass Display Counters and Vending Machines:[/h3] These are now temperature settable appliances for food storage. Some have Hot, Warm, or Cold others just Warm and Cold. Each segment has it's own settings. Now automatically spawn on when they can and switch to cold in ice cream parlors, cafes, bakeries, etc. Pizza parlors and other restaurants will default to warm. Soda Machines automatically default to cold.\r\n\r\n[h3]Industrial Deep Fryers:[/h3] The deep fryers are now setup to randomly have vegetable oil in them. You can add and drain the oil. If you have power you can turn them on and fry various foods that usually need a pan of oil with Sapph's Cooking mod. A few new recipes have been added: Doughboys, Chicken Fillets, Chicken Tenders, Blooming Onions, and Fried Cheese Sticks. Added Sapph's Cooking Oil for a second option to fill the vats.\r\n\r\n[h3]Pay Phones:[/h3] They have a minor interaction. If you touch them they might just ring but they'll attracted anyone that happens to be listening...\r\n\r\n[h3]Wall Clocks:[/h3] They will now display the time. Clicking on them will give you the current time. Wall clocks work based on electrical availability, once off the grid they run off a built in battery that slowly drains. Power up a generator and they will recharge over time. If you are desperate, you can drop a new standard flashlight battery into them, but that's a one way trip. Clocks now show 12hr format and stop when dead. All times accurate to the minute when powered.\r\n\r\n[h3]Paper Towel and Napkin Dispensers:[/h3] They show up as small containers and come standard with a few loose napkins. Napkins can now dry off players and wet napkins can wash off dirt and blood. In order to allow compatibility, the new ones drop in the dispensers. Vanilla game napkins have a conversion recipe to use them as well.\r\n\r\n[h3]Coffee X-Press and Espresso Machines:[/h3] Turn on the machines and make coffee. Use mugs, teacups, and thermos or lowballs from Sapph's. Tea and instant coffee options exist in the vanilla game to make a quick fix. Add Sapph's to get coffee beans that can be ground in the espresso machine. Then you can brew coffee or espresso. Take the espresso and foam it up in the espresso machine with any \"Milk\" type item and turn it into a latte or cappuccino. Don't forget you need power and water. If the water is off, any source in inventory will be used for the coffee.\r\n\r\n[h3]Bulletin Boards:[/h3] Both large and small corkboards, you can now add things into it's container and the random notices appear as overlays.\r\n\r\n[h3]Peg Boards:[/h3] Containers that spawn with tools and have an overlay.\r\n\r\n[h3]Pool Cue Stands:[/h3] Containers that spawn with pool cues and have an overlay.\r\n\r\n[h3]Green Oven Silo Generators:[/h3] It has the same depletion of fuel as a standard generator and the same radius of power. It can be turned on/off manually and has an auto start feature. It can be used as a backup to other generators and sense when it's time to start. It can be repaired with electronic scrap or scrap metal but will need the generator skill, electrical 4, or mechanics 4. The standard generator manual can spawn with the machine. It has a 500 fuel unit capacity and can be filled or emptied while running. There is no need to connect these as they are stationary and already connected. If found indoors they are also vented to keep the toxins out. If they run out of fuel they will shutdown, if they run out of condition they make a loud *BOOM* that attracts zombies in the area. Now moveable in 2.0 thanks to the Green Oven Corporation! \"When your power is lean, buy Green!\" \r\n\r\n[h1][b]***Fuel and Condition of generators zeros out when moving, empty first!***[/b][/h1]\r\n\r\nv2.07 Updated for B42 Not all aspects of the original Functional Appliances are available due to changes in the game.\r\n   Display cases, buffets, and vending machines still have temperature settings.\r\n   Peg boards still load tools.\r\n   Bulletin boards now have photos and fliers.\r\n   Napkins can be used to dry or wet them to wash yourself off in a pinch. Vanilla napkins can be converted to FA \r\n      versions.\r\n   Beer taps work with the kegs and pour into an empty vessel of choice.\r\n   Soda Fountains now have all the flavors available in the game, non-vanilla sodas will spawn with cans and bottles \r\n      too.\r\n   Popcorn machines use vanilla items to still make the popcorn.\r\n   Hotdogs can now be made with sausage or wieners and use the vanilla buns or bread slices. All can be cooked in \r\n      the machine.\r\n\r\nv2.08 hotfix\r\n   Corrected error with distribution in 42\r\n\r\n[h1][b]***On servers you may need to set anti-cheat 21 as false if it kicks players, it points to a file mismatch between player and server.***[/b][/h1]\r\n\r\nIf you see any bugs let me know. I tried to make the functions and items as unique as possible to keep from any conflicts.

    "description": "Greenport, KY\n\nEstablished in 1818, Greenport relied heavily on the fishing industry that the Ohio River provided for many years.  The local Cannery, was opened shortly after in 1821 by the town's first Mayor, Harrison Harrington.\n\nOver the decades, the town continued to grow and become more self sufficient, attracting in many different professionals and businesses.\n\nBy the late 1980's the interest of most residents of Greenport had moved on from fishing due to the growing prosperity of the town, resulting in the Cannery scaling back production.  Seeing the changes in the town, the Mayor believed promoting the town's growing local business scene would help draw in the tourists and bolster the coffers of Greenport.  His plans included renovating parts of the large Cannery into a Tourism center, granting local artisans vending liceses to operate out of the historic town square and the construction of a community swimming pool and open air gym adjacent to the square.\n\nAmenities in Greenport include: multiple fishing piers, gas station and mechanic shop, doctor's office, hunting and camping store, K-12 school, daycare, church and cemetary, bank, post office, book store, coffee shop, sewing store, barber shop, grocery and tool store, police station, bar as well as a beach and Fish n' Chip restaurant.\n\n\n\nA BIG thank you to SlenderGreen for her huge help in making this map become a reality. Your keen eye for detail and design helped bring this map to life! Also, another BIG thank you to the NoMiS Plays community for joining me on this map making journey on stream.

    "description": "How much fuel is there in the pump?  (For Build 41.51+)  Also works in Multiplayer Builds 41.60+\r\nConfirmed to work in build 41.71.\r\nKnown Issue:  PZ has a bug where if you set the custom initial fuel setting to \"Full\" it sets all pumps to have infinite fuel.  And if you set it to \"Infinite\" it gives you a lot of fuel (15k+ units on each pump).\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, my dad took me to his friend's gas station.  While dad was hanging out with his friend, I wandered the station, and noticed that there was a little display on the pumps indicating how much gas there was available for that pump.\r\n\r\nI don't know if those were on every pump in 1993, but for the sake of this mod let's assume they are.\r\n\r\nRight click on a gas pump for the context menu to check the fuel amount.\r\n\r\nTODO: Display \"Infinite\" when the game is set for infinite fuel.  Currently displays 1000 instead, because that is the amount PZ returns for infinite fuel.  I will not change this item until after Indie Stone fixes its Infinite fuel bug.  When you set fuel amount to \"Infinite\" it is actually just set to a large amount (over 15k).  When you set fuel amount to \"Full\" the pumps actually have infinite fuel (displaying 1000 in this mod).\r\n\r\nIf you want to know how much fuel is typical in Project Zomboid, I did a test in Muldraugh:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/optrpl/how_much_gas_in_a_4152_gas_station_gas2go_in/\r\n(The amount of fuel in 41.71 appears to be the same as it was in build 41.52)\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2553593324\r\nMod ID: HowMuchFuel",

    "description": "Dynamic and immersive hunting mod that lets you scavange for traces of animals and then track and hunt them. It uses the foraging system combined with player's skills, traits, weather, luck and mood Once you find and pick up the traces they will spawn infront of you on the ground, from where you can further investigate and track the game (You can't take the traces/tracks with you and are forced to hunt where you foraged/investigated them. They will dissappear in 3 days if not used to hunt). [b]Works both in SP and MP and can be added/removed mid-game[/b].\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/v8UuOlU.png[/img]\r\n[code] \r\n[list]\r\n[*]Four different types of animals can be tracked and hunted : Rabbit, birds, deer and wild pig.\r\n[*]Traces of animals can be found in every zone but they most likely appear in deep forest.\r\n[*]Small game traces can be found with foraging skill 2 and up\r\n[*]Big game traces can be found with foraging skill 4 and up\r\n[*]Often birds can be spotted without any skill and don't need to be tracked.\r\n[*]Most important skills for tracking is foraging and sneaking.\r\n[*]Traits like Hunter, Outdoorsman and Former Scout get better results while tracking.\r\n[*]Bad weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, snow or wind make it harder to track game.\r\n[/list]\r\n[/code] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/afrrOVw.png[/img]\r\n[code] \r\n[list]\r\n[*]Hunting action will make an actual shooting sound and will attract zombies.\r\n[*]Hunting rifles have better chance of getting a big animal then shotguns. Shotguns are better against birds.\r\n[*]If your rifle have a scope then this helps along a lot too. Just make sure your rifle is equiped while hunting.\r\n[*]Most important skills for hunting with a gun is Aiming and Sneaking. \r\n[*]Most important skills for hunting with a spear is Spear, Fitness, Strenght and Sneaking.\r\n[*]Traits like Hunter, Outdoorsman, Desensitized, Eagle Eyed and Former Scout get better results while hunting.\r\n[*]Traits like Clumsy and Short Sighted lower the chances a bit to succesfully hunt a game.\r\n[*]Bad weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, snow or wind make it harder to hunt game.\r\n[*]When you are sick or just feel cold then this will lower the chances a bit to succesfully hunt a game as well.\r\n[*]Hunters get mood bonus when hunting, tracking or butchering game. Hemophobic's get stress from hunting and butchering.\r\n[*]Birds and rabbits have the vanilla nutrition value(Its is raised if you also use [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2890748284]Food Preservation Plus[/url][/b]) and [b]deer(base 17000 calories)[/b] and wild [b]pig(base 10000 calories)[/b] is from this mod. Nutrition values are multiplied randomly from 0.5 to 1.5. \r\n[*]Small animals give the meat you'd get from vanilla trapping and Deer/Pig will give you chunks of meat(Renamed steak, item won't change and can be used in all the recipes a regular steak could be)\r\n[*]I did not add more bigger animals as I wanna make a fine balance between fishing , farming and trapping food supplies. Just roleplay the bears and elks were zombified as well.\r\n[*]Works good in combination with my food resource re-balancing series: [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886457020]Hard Forage[/url][/b], [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909936075]Hard Trapping[/url][/b], [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899681016]Hard Farming[/url][/b] and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886456626]Hard Fishing[/url][/b].\r\n\r\nAdded compatibility to [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256623447]Firearms B41[/url][/b], [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2208315526]Bow and Arrow[/url][/b](Can only hunt rabbits with a bow) and for some weapons from [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2200148440]Brita[/url][/b].\r\n\r\n\r\n[/list]\r\n[/code] \r\n\r\nUse [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2890748284]Food Preservation Plus[/url][/b] mod to have a lot more options on what to do with the meat.

    "description": "[h1] About [/h1]\r\nTired of scrolling to your equipped section of the inventory to check your weapon's status and attachments?\r\n\r\nThis mod allows you to inspect your currently equipped weapon on your primary hand at anytime, by:\r\n\r\n- Hold down the reload button and choose \"Inspect Weapon\"\r\n- Right click on any weapon in your inventory or a world container and choose \"Inspect Weapon\"  will automatically try to equip it in your primary hand slot and inspect it\r\n- Pressing [b];[/b] button to inspect current weapon. You can rebind this button through PZ's default option menu\r\n\r\nThis mod comes with a simple UI and a terrible animation that took an hour to make :)\r\n\r\n[h1] Stats & Navigating UI [/h1]\r\nUnlike the exact stats that are shown within the weapon's tooltip, the \"condition\" and \"number of repair\" stat are shown in estimation text (yes, I took this out of the DayZ book). I personally think that this will give players a better immersion on how their characters physically see the condition of the weapon, rather than numbers on a datasheet.\r\n\r\n[b] Condition [/b]\r\n- Pristine: This weapon has a perfect 100% condition, and on top of that, it was never repaired\r\n- Used: This weapon has a condition between 50%, all the way to 100%. Weapons that are 100% but were repaired even once will get knocked down from \"Pristine\", to this category\r\n- Damaged: This weapon has a condition between 30% to 50%\r\n- Badly Damaged: This weapon has its condition less than 30%\r\n\r\n[b] Number of repair [/b]\r\n- No sign of repair: Pretty self-explanatory, this weapon hasn't been repaired even once\r\n- Slightly repaired: This weapon has been repaired, but less than 3 times\r\n- Heavily repaired: This weapon has been repaired at least 3 times\r\n\r\nIt is sort of hard to determine what's the good number for \"Number of repair\" stat. Realistically, I think 3 times duct taping or replacing some parts of a firearm would look noticeable enough to be deemed \"Heavily repaired\"\r\n\r\n[b] Repair [/b]\r\nIf weapon is damaged, an \"information\" button will be shown next to \"Number of repair\" stat. You can press on it and directly fix your weapon from the pop-up context menu, just like how you usually do it within the inventory pane\r\n\r\n[b] Attachments [/b]\r\nThis section is only shown for ranged weapon. I am not too sure if the melee weapons can use attachments (or any mods out there that allows it), prove me wrong :)\r\n\r\nAttachments can be equipped by clicking on a blank attachment slot, and a list should show options for compatible attachments for that slot. To un-equip it, double clicking on a currently equipped slot.\r\n\r\nFor \"Magazine\" slot specifically, ammo will be shown for each one, and you can choose to load or unload them by right clicking on them.\r\n\r\n[b] For controller [/b]\r\nYou can navigate the UI using D-Pad buttons, with [i]A (South) Button[/i] as accept, [i]B (East) Button[/i] as Back/Close, and [i]X (West) Button[/i] as Context/Sub menu\r\n\r\nAlso please be advised, I am aware of the issue that the radial menu entry not showing. This has to do with other gun mods overwriting all the radial menu entries. For VFE specifically, I am working with the devs to figure out a solution to that.\r\n\r\n[h1] To-do list [/h1]\r\n[b] High priority [/b]\r\n- [strike]Repair weapon[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Indication for screwdriver in inventory[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Potential fits into attachment slot[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Magazine display (if applicable)[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Working with multiplayer[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Custom keybind to inspect current weapon[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Window position save[/strike]\r\n\r\n[b] Low priority [/b]\r\n- [strike]Controller support for all my Steam Deck homies out there[/strike]\r\n- [strike]Splitscreen coop support[/strike]\r\n- Add ability to move window for controller\r\n- Skill check to enable potential fits into attachment slot\r\n\r\n[h1] Frequently asked questions [/h1]\r\n[b] Is this compatible with VFE? [/b]\r\n- Some adjustments to the mod has been made for VFE for attachments of several firearms to show up. There might be other undiscovered issues, so if you have found any, let me know how to recreate it.\r\n\r\n[b] Is this compatible with other weapon mods? [/b]\r\n- So far several of them were confirmed to be working, but some might have some issues, if they introduce new mechanics to how vanilla weapon should work. I can't test it all myself, so do try it for yourself. My goal for this mod is to keep it as compatible with the vanilla as possible, so any changes in the future by IndieStone wouldn't affect it too much.\r\n\r\n[b] Why don't those melee weapons have inspect animation? [/b]\r\n- I actually do not know how to make the animation for this to look interesting enough...? I'm open for suggestion on this one.\r\n\r\n[b] Does it work with B42? [/b]\r\n- Currently, yes!\r\n\r\n[h1] Feedback [/h1]\r\nThis is my first ever published mod. It took about a week of work to make. Any feedback from the end-user experience, to code improvement is appreciated.\r\n\r\n[h1] Credits [/h1]\r\nMassive thanks to:\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/vilespring]Vilespring[/url] for helping with VFE integration\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Booker_D_Fred]Booker_D_Fred[/url] for code review/suggestions\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmeg]Jarl44[/url] for potential attachment feature suggestion\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrshersh]Mr.Shersh[/url] for reminding me to add disclaimer about having attachment in main inventory\r\n\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/BryanXim]BryanComY[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/NopOYes]NopOYes[/url] for Brazilian Portuguese translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199401473704] Inferno [/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dydimos] Dydimos [/url] for Spanish translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/safc] Riko Prushka [/url] for Thai translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Booker_D_Fred]Booker_D_Fred[/url] for Russian translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/HugoTLS]HugoTLS[/url] for French translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ishev4enkoI]secdet[/url] for Ukrainian translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/NozownikHere]Nozownik[/url] for Polish translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198412478002]Dunganga[/url] for Turkish translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198177186117]76561198177186117[/url] for Traditional Chinese translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/gladicek]Gladicek[/url] for Czech translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198331661434]KimLeon[/url] for Korean translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eternity84]Eternity[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Art_Tippet]Art Tippet[/url] for Italian translation\r\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198147574632]Lampiooo[/url] for German translation\r\n\r\n[b]Like the mod?

    "description": "Workshop ID: 566115016\r\nModID: ItemTweakerAPI\r\n\r\n--EDIT 3  - End of Support --\r\nI thank you all who have subscribed, and with these numbers am humbled. \r\nI am aware this mod no longer works for build 42. I am okay with this, and in fact am glad, as this mod was honestly never really needed. It has been 9 years, and was once drastically needed to help spread modding awareness, this is by far no longer true. \r\nIt is time to return the attention this mod has been given back to the Zomboid devs, who laid the framework this mod piggybacked.\r\n\r\nFor Context: \r\nThis mod was built during a time where new Zomboid modders would release mods containing entire files worth of item definitions, in order to only change a single entry, thus removing any changes a mod loaded previously would make.\r\n\r\nThis mod mod makes use of code that Zomboid always had simply to make new modders know how to make mods more compatible. I honestly never intended for people to continue to use this mod for their mods for the last 9 years instead of discovering the real method behind how to do it themselves. \r\n\r\nThat being said, while I appreciate the support, and the sheer number of people subscribing, I am going to keep this mod in a mothballed state, ending support for build 42 onward, but keeping it available to any mod still relying on it in build 41. Feel free to unsubscribe when the time for it comes, but it's still been quite a trip.\r\n\r\n--EDIT 2--\r\nFor those of you who are -still- getting missing file errors, Unsubscribe from the other item tweaker here.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2510747487\r\n\r\nHaving both versions subscribed list alone can cause issues, as they are using the same ModID, and is 100% confusing your game's mod enabling/loading attempts.\r\n\r\nThis alone is making it try to load both my still working code, and the outdated version's now broken code.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if this issue is still happening, and you know you haven't subscribed to this mod, then there may be another mod you've subscribed to that is still using the outdated mod's script files.\r\n\r\nI recommend looking into which those are, and suggest those mods switch back to this still working version.\r\n\r\n ---EDIT---\r\nIt's come to my attention that there is another version of item tweaker that had been updated at one point. While it may have been an improvement at one point, and I thank him for trying to keep this mod alive, his version is apparently causing many issues in the new build. This version seems to still work very well.\r\n\r\nI have not been modding for PZ in quite a long time, however knowing this mod still works now as it did before makes me feel glad to have been part of the modding community. Should this start acting up for real, I may pass it on to someone more active, but as of now, I hope you continue to enjoy it. Thank you again Brybry and Blindcoder for helping to make improved mod compatability possible all these years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---ORIGINAL POST---\r\n\r\nThis modding API allows any modders to more simply make multiple changes to any items loaded into the game's current database, while leaving the rest of the remaining values alone. This uses code that Zomboid already has implemented, but intended for new modders that haven't discovered those commands yet.\r\n\r\nChange any item's weight, display name, display category, hunger reduction, or anything else, while keeping the item as mod friendly as possible. \r\n(WARNING: changing TYPE will delete all instances of already spawned items) \r\n\r\nYou can change only an item icon, while another mod changes the same item's weight, all without conflict (Unless mods do not use this mod to do so, or two mods try to change the same value, in which case, the last loaded mod will win) \r\n\r\nFor the Simplest Implementation through LUA: \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------Begin File \r\nif getActivatedMods():contains(\"ItemTweakerAPI\") then \r\nrequire(\"ItemTweaker_Core\"); \r\nelse return end \r\n\r\nTweakItem(\"Base.Needle\",\"Icon\", \"Worm\");\r\nTweakItem(\"Base.Needle\",\"Tooltip\", \"Wearable: Waist\");\r\nTweakItem(\"Base.Needle\",\"DisplayCategory\", \"Repair\");\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------End File \r\nFor each item and property you wish to change, create a new line, and place the related values in place. \r\n\r\nYou can even add custom ModData to items.\r\nTweakItem(\"Base.Needle\",\"BaseValue\", \"500\");\r\n\r\nOrganized Item Names is an example mod to hopefully show beginner modders how to make use of this API\r\n\r\nMods I know of using this API: \r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502286003] Custom Categories[/url] \r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=714554934] JPCategoriesPlus[/url]  - By: Proxyer\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498547445] Littering[/url]  - By: Svarog\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=699161589] Jaw Stab Proliferation[/url]  - By: LoonyLadel\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148522195] Wedge's Item Name Fixes[/url]  - By: Wedge McCloud (Includes changes for some other mods)\r\n[strike][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502286003] Custom Categories[/url][/strike](Outdated: Use Wedge's Item Name Fixes instead)\r\n[strike][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569235671] Organized Item Names[/url][/strike] (Outdated: Use Wedge's Item Name Fixes instead)\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1165204481] Wedge's Hydrocraft Tweaks[/url]  - By: Wedge McCloud (Requires Hydrocraft)\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1273960779] Better Carts[/url]  - By: yuriy206 (Requires Hydrocraft)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Their minds are extremely broken & degraded, but despite it all, you can sometimes witness 1-4 understandable words amongst the endless thrum of undeciphered protospeech.

    "description": "[h1]NOW COMPATIBLE with 42.8[/h1]\r\n\r\n- Corrected the duplication bug\r\n- Refactored the free recipe code so it's limited per crafting category and better to visualize\r\n- Added Inventive description\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\nThis mod is intended for players who are confused about what effects each trait and profession has on the character.\r\n\r\nIt adds description to the traits that need it to describe their effects on the character in detail, instead of leaving people guessing with vague sentences. This way, players can have an easier time imagining their own builds by themselves.\r\n\r\nIt also adds the description on mouse hover in the character's info screen, in game. This works with descriptions of traits from other mods too, like Banjo's item kits or Dynamic traits for example.\r\n\r\nThis is based on a combination of my own knowledge, the game's non-exposed Java files (that I learned how to decompile),  the game's exposed Lua files,  your feedback, and the wiki of PZ.\r\n\r\nMost of what I added in the traits' descriptions are in parenthesis so you can distinguish what is vanilla description and what is not.\r\n\r\nIf you notice a typo, or know of an effect that is not listed, or spot something that is wrong or poorly worded, please leave a comment to point it out to me. I don't think I got every single effect that could be listed, and I may have made a mistake somewhere, so I'm relying on you guys for that.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\r\nWorks with build 41, in multiplayer b41. DOESNT WORK with 42.8.\r\nIt should be compatible with any mod that adds traits or skills.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1]Translations[/h1]\r\nB41 translations are CLOSED.\r\nB42 translations are open , but be advised that it risks becoming obsolete soon as B42 gets more matches, and I will most likely take a couple weeks to add the translation.\r\n\r\nAnyone is welcome to volunteer to translate to their language.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1] Foraging stats:[/h1]\r\nThe mod details the foraging stats bonuses for each trait and profession.\r\nStats are : Foraging radius bonus, Weather Effect reduction, and Darkness Effect reduction and also Specialisation bonuses for every foraging category.\r\nAll foraging stats are added dynamically, which means any balance changes will be automatically updated, and other traits that get foraging stats in their descriptions (if they have foraging stats).\r\nSource file: media/lua/shared/Foraging/forageDefinitions.lua\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1] Character Info Screen Tooltip:[/h1]\r\nThe mod displays the detailed description of each trait in the character's info screen window on mouse hover. Works for professions too (except Unemployed since it doesn't have an image).\r\nWorks with traits of other mods too! Although their descriptions probably won't be as detailed.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1]Dynamic Free recipes[/h1]\r\nFree recipes have been dynamically added to each trait and profession description, which means any future free recipe changes in vanilla will automatically show up on this mod, without needing to update the mod.\r\nModded traits will also have their free recipes added to their description, just like the foraging stats. And modded recipes will also dynamically show up if they are given for free to a trait or profession.\r\nAs of 42.8 I limited the number of recipes that can show up on one trait.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1]Mod Options[/h1]\r\nThere are now 3 mod options :\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Show more description \r\n[*]Show Free Recipes\r\n[*]Show Foraging Stats\r\n[/list]\r\nSo you can now disable the things you don't want to see.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1]Give your feedback[/h1]\r\n\r\nI've tried to be as exhaustive as possible, but I'm sure I've made some mistakes or interpreted things wrongly here and there.

    "description": "[h1][u][b]v1.3.6[/b][/u] (Nov 25th 2023) :[/h1]\r\n- Fixed incompatibility with 'The Workshop' mod in multiplayer\r\n- Fixed female zombie loot not being affected by custom zombie loot\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1][u][b]Please check the mod's description before asking questions.[/b][/u][/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds custom loot options to the Sandbox Settings, including:\r\n- A [b]zombie loot[/b] multiplier (affects loot of generic zombies, special zombie outfits, and bags)\r\n- A [b]global chance of attached/lodged weapons[/b] on zombies (default is 6%)\r\n- A [b]chance of attached/lodged long blades[/b] on zombies (default is 1)\r\n- A [b]chance of attached/lodged hunting knives[/b] on zombies (default is 5)\r\n- A [b]days passed required for attached/lodged weapon spawns[/b] on zombies (can be none, quarter, half, normal or double)\r\n- An option to set the number of [b]max rolls[/b] for ALL loot tables (see Max Rolls section for more info)\r\n- An option to set the number of [b]max rolls[/b] for FOOD loot tables (see Max Rolls section for more info)\r\n- [b][u]13 different item chance multipliers[/u][/b] for many categories of items (they don't affect zombie loot)\r\n- An [b]exceptions list[/b] ( a semicolon-separated list of items that will not be affected by the multipliers above)\r\n- A [b]specific items multipliers list[/b] ( a semicolon-separated list of items with multipliers)\r\n- The [b]number of cigarettes[/b] found per loot (default to 20 in vanilla)\r\n- Specified loot modifiers displayed for vanilla rarity settings: Extremely Rare (x0.2), Rare (x0.6), Normal (x1), Common(x2) and Abundant(x3).\r\n\r\n[h1]\"I just want less loot than Extremely Rare\"[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Still set everything on \"Extremely Rare\"\r\n[*] Set the Global Max Rolls option at 1, 2 or 3\r\n[*] Set all the chance multipliers to a value below 1\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]\"I just want less food\"[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Still set Fresh Food and Canned Food on \"Extremely Rare\"\r\n[*] Set the Food Loot Max Rolls option at 1, 2 or 3\r\n[*] Set the Food Chance Multiplier to a value below 1\r\n[*] Also set the House Story Chance on Extremely Rare\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]WARNING:[/h1]\r\nThe chance multipliers are applied [u][b]ON TOP OF[/b][/u] the standard loot rarity options. (Insanely Rare, Extremely Rare, Rare, etc.)\r\n\r\n[h1]Exceptions List:[/h1]\r\nA semicolon-separated list of items IDs. Useful is you want to spare an item from the loot multipliers. Looking at you, Sledgehammer.\r\n[u]Example:[/u]\r\n[i]Base.Sledgehammer;Base.Sledgehammer2;Base.Saw;Base.NailsBox;farming.HandShovel;camping.CampingTentKit[/i]\r\n[b]Note :[/b] The items in this list will still be affected by the Specific Items Multipliers List below !\r\n\r\n[h1]Specific Items Multipliers List:[/h1]\r\nA semicolon-separated list of items IDs and multipliers values. Useful to apply individual nerfs or buffs to the loot chances of specific items. Also applies to the items in the exception list above.\r\n[u]Example:[/u]\r\n[i]Base.Sledgehammer:5;Base.Sledgehammer2:5;Base.Saw:0.5;Base.NailsBox:2;farming.HandShovel:0.1;camping.CampingTentKit:0.1[/i]\r\n[b]Note:[/b] you could also remove an item from the loot tables by giving it a chance multiplier = 0.\r\n\r\n[h1]Global Max Rolls and Food Loot Max Rolls:[/h1]\r\nRolls affect loot tables, not item chances like the chance multipliers.\r\nAll loot table have a \"rolls\" key. Most tables have its value at 4, but some have it at 1, 2, 3 or 5. It is directly linked to how many items the table will spawn.\r\nIf set at 3, all tables with a rolls value at 4 or 5 will be set to 3. But not those who have their rolls value at 1 or 2. It is a \"MAX rolls\" setting.\r\nSince most tables have a rolls value of 4, here's what you can expect for each setting:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] 1 : loot will be reduced by ~75%. (basically what \"Ridiculously Rare\" mod does.)\r\n[*] 2 : loot will be reduced by ~50%.\r\n[*] 3 : loot will be reduced by ~25%.\r\n[*] 4 : only a few unimportant tables will be affected. Pretty much no impact on the loot.\r\n[*] 5 : default vanilla value.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Items added to zombie loot[/h1]\r\nA semicolon-separated list of items IDs and chances that will be added to generic zombie loot. (the \"inventorymale\" loot table) (Added AFTER the multipliers are applied)\r\n[u]Example:[/u]\r\n[i]Base.Money:0.01;Base.Hammer:0.001;Base.Nails:0.05[/i]\r\n[b]NEW in v1.2[/b] There are now many options for many zed categories (military zeds, police zeds, medical zeds...). As well as a customized list of outfits that will drop a custom list of items. The format is the same as the example above. If you want to know which outfits belong to which category, see the list of zed outfits in the Discussion.\r\n[u]Warning:[/u] With these lists, if you make a typo and an error occurs (red box bottom right), it is possible that the distribution tables completely reset to their vanilla state.\r\n[u][b]CHECK THE LOOTZED TOOL IN DEBUG BEFORE REPORTING A BUG.[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[h1]The mod \"Time Decreases Loot\" is INCLUDED in More Loot Settings.[/h1]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/rOYTt5k.png[/IMG]\r\nFor more info on this, check out the standalone mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2836575002]Time Decreases Loot [/url] .\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/q2soh0H.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people say it works good. Other people say they have their sandbox settings get reset to their default value. This can be avoided by directly changing the default values in the mod's files.\r\nI can't test it myself so I don't really know.\r\nTime Decreases Loot can be finnicky in multiplayer. You MUST disable the trigger on dead bodies and the trigger on proximity. Yoy may also need to disable triggers on vehicles.\r\n[hr]\r\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/hH2PGen.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n- Map mods like [b][u]Pitstop[/u][/b] : As of v1.1.1, fully compatible\r\n- [b][u]Better Sorting[/u][/b] : Fully compatible.\r\n- [b][u]Ridiculously Rare[/u][/b] : Fully compatible. (rolls are set to 1)\r\n- [u][b]Smoker[/b][/u] : you will need to set the 'number of cigarettes' option to 1.\r\n- [u][b]True Music[/b][/u] : As of v1.3, fully compatible.\r\n- [u][b]Better Sorting[/b][/u] : fully compatible.\r\n- Mods that change item display categories (except Better Sorting) will work but item chances may not be multiplied correctly as intended.\r\n- Mods that add items or tweak distributions: Compatible, as long as they set standard display categories for them.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to run my other mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3033301901][u]\"Vanilla Loot Tables Fixed\"[/u][/url] along with this, but it's not strictly necessary.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2812491628\r\nMod ID: MoreLootSettings",

    "description": "Have you ever felt like cutting down a horde of zombies felt a little underwhelming? Perhaps seeing the same death animation repeat over and over again took away some of the fun and enjoyment that you would have otherwise gotten. Thanks to this mod, cutting down hordes of zombies will be as exciting as ever, featuring both quick and dramatic death animations to enhance your zombie slaying experience.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-Changes and adds various zombie death animations utilizing unused developer assets. (five in total)\r\n-The animations are tied to a zombie's walk animation, allowing for more animation variety than in vanilla.\r\n-Works with melee, ranged, and even throwable weapons\r\n-Works with zombies who die to fire and explosives\r\n-Compatible with popular animation mods such as Authentic Animations, True Actions, and\r\n Fancy Handwork\r\n-Should be fully compatible with any mod that doesn't make changes to the zombie death animations or the zombie falldown and walktoward folders\r\n\r\n[b]Important[/b]: This mod works best when zombie speed is set to fast shamblers (default) or sprinters. Zombies set to shambler speed will only have three out of the five death animations.\r\n\r\nWorks with multiplayer.  Server-sided.\r\nSafe to add or remove from an existing save game.\r\n\r\n[b]Information Regarding Build 42[/b]: \r\n\r\nHello everyone,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I just wanted to thank all of you for the support and kind words in the comment section. I'm glad my mod was able to bring enjoyment to your various Zomboid playthroughs. As I have stated previously, I was originally planning to update this mod to build 42 as long as the developers didn't make any major changes to the animation system.\r\n\r\nHowever, during my brief testing of build 42's unstable build, it seems that the developers have completely overhauled the part of the animation system that I made modifications to. Their new system seems to take both the weapon type and swing direction into account when a zombie is killed, making my mod inferior to their new system. Additionally, the animation rework that the developers introduced in build 42 was actually my original goal when making this mod.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that I have decided to not update this mod to build 42. It will stay on the Steam page for those of you who prefer to play on build 41, but it will not receive any further updates.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the support, and have fun in build 42!\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 3147442677\r\nMod ID: More_Zombie_Death_Animations",

    "description": "[h1]Getting Started with Homebrewing Beer in PZ[/h1]\nI have been diligently putting this together to share one of my personal hobbies with the PZ community. I did my best to capture the process of brewing beer from start to finish.\n\n[h1]WINE ME UP! - 3.01 Edition:[/h1]\nA very large edition to the mod basically doubling the foundation of MoreBrews. This includes the ability to create/ferment/age/bottle a variety of different wines. Here is the following list of new alcoholic beverages:\n\n[h1]Wines & More:[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*]Pinot Nior\n  [*]Merlot\n  [*]Cabernet Sauvignon\n  [*]Pinot Grigio\n  [*]Riesling\n  [*]Sauvignon Blanc\n  [*]Banana Wine\n  [*]Peach Wine\n  [*]Pear Wine\n  [*]Pineapple Wine\n  [*]Rosehip Wine\n  [*]Strawberry Wine\n  [*]Wild Berry Wine\n  [*]Honey Mead\n  [*]Hard Cider\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What else happened:[/h1]\nThis was designed as a branch build so you can choose between only beer or only wine or select to have both. They function together or accommodate being on their own. Tested to function with version 41.73 and also still works with 41.71 to accommodate MP servers.\n[list]\n  [*] New Vintner trait can be earned or selected on character creation\n  [*] 5 New Wine making Magazines to learn how to interact with the content\n  [*] Streamlined fermentation process, much more reliable than previous iteration\n  [*] Naming convention, icons, and tooltips adjusted to create clearer directions\n  [*] Distribution reimagined to ease those loot tables but Wine/Brewing kits got an upgrade on its contents\n  [*] 15 different custom bottle textures, 6 wine box textures, and varying barrel textures added\n  [*] Heavy lean into foraged goods + make use of those corks you find (plus new bags of them added)\n  [*] 1 Gallon batches lead to 5 bottles and Large barrels lead to 20 - aging red and white wine mechanic included\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Is it safe to add / remove?[/h1]\nPrevious carboys will have disappeared due to item change to fix the fermentation process. Was tested with an old save, in 41.71 and within 41.73. Otherwise no original items were edited, should be able to add or remove this mod at any time. Safe to say you will lose any items you gained from this mod if you remove it. [b][i]NOTE: This has not been thoroughly tested against other mods or in MP[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]Where do I find supplies[/h1]\nBrewing/Wine Kits will be found mostly in Gigamarts but rarely in garages. A few supplies will be found in tool shops (Bottle Capper + Can Sealer). Beer and wine bottles will be in bars and in a minimal amount of fridges. The remaining supplies will need to be crafted or obtained through kits.\n\n[h1]Additional Information[/h1]\nMost likely will be adding in a distilling process for spirits.

Game will recognize what items are within range of more than one generator and split fuel usage across them proportionally. Check how generator info data changes when you turn on more generators.\r\n\r\nFinally your frozen rabbits are safe and you can safely go scavenging.\r\n\r\nAs an extra feature, stove power consumption depends on temperature setting.  Probably more fine-tuning options will be added later. \r\n\r\nGenerator info window is slightly more neat so that you can easily see the list of devices on their power usage. \r\n\r\nAdditionally you can see a graph for historical data of power usage. If you you solar panels mod then you can see the effect of the failsafe that was triggered.

We are currently working on a huge update, Music for the End of the World 2.0, which will hopefully fix these issues. Hang in there![/b][/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]Note 2: This mod is about 4 gigabytes. If that's too much for you, consider a smaller pack. It's a lot of music files, it's going to take up space on your computer and there is no smaller I can make it.[/h1] \r\n\r\n[h1]Music for the End of the World seeks to be the ultimate lore-friendly True Music pack for those who just can't get enough tunes in their Apocalypse.[/h1]\r\nThis monolithic True Music mod is the result of dozens and dozens of hours of work and tons of helpful requests from the Project Zomboid community. It's based on Tsar's True Music framework, and was originally titled \"Rose Music\", and produced for the enjoyment of the Ravenrose RP community. However, the mod far outgrew its original scope, leading to a public release.\r\n\r\n[h1]This True Music mod adds 1,000 tracks, listed [url=https://pastebin.com/s8KJJxSN]here.[/url][/h1]\r\nThis mod's features include:\r\n- [b]725[/b] completely lore-friendly tracks from the year 1993 or before.\r\n- [b]250[/b] more tracks in the 'Extended' expansion which are mostly from between the years of 1994 and 2000, but with a few between 2001 and 2004.\r\n- [b]25[/b]...? tracks in the Silent Hill expansion, which adds a collection of songs from across the series... and some extremely rare extras from another 2008 horror game that drop from zombies (though this can be toggled).\r\n\r\n- Vinyl covers for every single track from the Main and Extended branches.\r\n- Three different kinds of rare 'loot boxes' to find that contain either 50, 25, or 10 of their respective music item.\r\n- A completely unique loot distribution system designed to account for the vast amount of items added by this mod.\r\n\r\n- Total customization. You can customize:\r\n-- Whether or not Cassettes or Vinyls spawn\r\n-- How many, and how frequently, they spawn\r\n-- Whether cassettes can drop from zombies, and how frequently they do\r\n-- The weight of all cassettes, vinyls, and the Boombox\r\n-- The rate at which Boomboxes consume batteries\r\n-- Whether or not 'loot boxes' can spawn, how many items they give, and how often they spawn\r\n\r\nAll of the mods in this pack are optional [b]except for Music for the End of the World: Core or MusicfortheEndOP[/b] which is [b]required[/b] for [b]any[/b] of the packs to function. It contains no music itself, only code handling loot distribution, sandbox settings and the 'loot boxes'.\r\n\r\n[h1]Want a tasteful dash of modern songs? Check out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915429368]Music for the End of the World: Home Labelled![/url][/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]Credits[/h1]\r\n[b]Lea[/b], myself, did most of the creative legwork behind the mod, as well as all of the grunt work collecting, converting, and implementing songs, writing some portions of code, and generally 'designing' the mod. If you have questions or need to get in contact about the mod, I am the one to contact.\r\n[b]Albion[/b] wrote a great majority of the unique code that gives MFTEOTW its many powerful features, particularly the loot distribution system and item boxes.

So you won't be able to wear rings with them which won't be an issue for most.\r\n\r\nAll of the slings no longer take up the sling slot, so you can wear something from another mod.\r\n\r\nIf the tweak isn't working then you need to use Mod Manager to change the load order and make sure that this tweak is loaded after Noir's mod.

Therefore, this mod has been updated to be compatible with Build 42 in case door key spawning is reintroduced in the future. It's difficult to check the implementation frequently, so if you can confirm that spawn on the door have been restored with this mod for B42, please let me know![/b][/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]Overview & Features :[/h1]\r\nCar keys spawn in the ignition, glove box, buildings near the vehicle, on the ground, and on zombies, but there is also a low probability that they will spawn on the \"vehicle door\". However, when it spawns on a vehicle door, there is no way to confirm that it has spawned, and it seems that the key can only be retreived under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this mod will add the feature to automatically retrieve the keys from the door and notify the player with a message when the player attempts to enter a vehicle whose keys are spawned on the door, regardless of the conditions.\r\n[b][i]Confirmed to work with Build 41/42 and also work on MP.[/i][/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]Q&A :[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][h2]What is the probability of a key spawning on a vehicle door?[/h2]\r\nIt is 1/4 probability compared to the spawn to the glove box. Of course, spawning keys on the door is not a feature of this mod, but of vanilla. This mod only reteives keys that have already spawn on the door.\r\n\r\n[*][h2]Is it possible to retrieve the key from the door without using this mod?[/h2]\r\nYes, it's possible. If a key is spawned on the door, it can be retrieved when trying to enter through a locked door. However, there is no notification, and the key is only silently added to your inventory.\r\n\r\n[*][h2]Do I need to try entering through every door to retrieve the key from the door?[/h2]\r\nNo, as long as the key is spawned on the door of that car, the key can be retrieved by entering through any door.\r\n\r\n[*][h2]Does it work even if it's enabled in the middle of the save data? Or do I need a new game?[/h2]\r\nThis mod makes it easier to get keys spawned on doors, rather than having them spawned on doors. Therefore, a new game is not required.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Options :[/h1]\r\nThese options are available with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169435993]Mod Options[/url] in B41.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Finding Message Notification : Can specify whether to enable or disable.\r\n[*]Sound Volume (Found) : You can adjust the sound volume when you find the key on the door.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Known Issues :[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Nothing\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Future plans :[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Bug fix (if it exists)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Release Notes :[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]v1.5 - Compatible with Build 42.\r\n[*]v1.4 - Added Sound Options.\r\n[*]v1.3 - Added ranslation (ES).\r\n[*]v1.2 - Added sound effect file for replacement.\r\n[*]v1.1 - Added ranslation (KO, PTBR, TH).\r\nPlease refer to \"Change Notes\" for the older history.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\nIf you enjoy this mod and would like to support its development, you can do so through the services below.

At the time I created the map, vehicles had not been implemented yet, so willy-nilly, the only way to go there was on foot. I add this map as a separate mod because I'll probably be expanding it northwards in the future, with numerous updates, and since the other map is also used for Build 40 in multiplayer, having this as a sperate mod will allow me to update it and work on in without creating problems for the 41.000 subscribers of the main mod.

Read Autostyle Magazine - Vehicle Painting: volume 1 teaches how to paint vehicles, volume 2 - how to mix paint. Mechanics (or any other) skill doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThen you need to do the following:\r\n[olist]\r\n[*]Wash your car if it's dirty.\r\n[*]Uninstall all windows from it.\r\n[*][b]Sand vehicle:[/b] remove old paint and rust. Requires Wire Brush.\r\n[*][b]Prime vehicle:[/b] prepare surface for new paint. Requires Spray Primer.\r\n[*][b]Paint Your Ride![/b] You have two options:\r\n  [list]\r\n  [*]Paint with ready-to-use sprays - 25 predefined colors for you. Find HSV Spray Paint Catalogue to preview the available colors;\r\n  [*]Mix any color you want.\r\n  In order to do that you need Automotive Paint White and any Tinting Paints (7 available, or you can paint with just clear white paint), and, of course, Spray Gun (requires battery to operate) to apply. Find HSV Tinting Paint Catalogue for tints proportions for some colors.\r\n  [/list]\r\n[/olist]\r\n\r\nEvery step (except washing) requires personal protective equipment. One of the following:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Dust Mask and Safety Goggles;\r\n[*]Gas Mask;\r\n[*]Nuclear Biochemical Mask.\r\n[/list]\r\nSafety first!\r\n\r\n[h3]Paint amounts[/h3]\r\nOne paint can has 10 units of paint.\r\nThe larger the car, the more paint is required. Ranges from 21 (2.1 cans) to 45 units (4.5 cans) for the vanilla vehicles.\r\nOne tinting paint bottle has 100 units of paint.\r\nTo mix a color you can use up to 100 units of each tint. You can achieve same color with different tints combinations.\r\n\r\n[h3]Items spawn[/h3]\r\nSpray and tinting paints are distributed mostly in boxes: open them to get up to 4 spray cans of one color or up to 8 tints (6 different + 2 black).

Some shops and restaurants have already been found in the game, while others were invented by me and this is my special pride.\n\nIn the city you can find many decorative items such as paintings that I painted in real life, replicas of weapons that can be hung on the wall and various furniture, which I personally really missed before.\n\n[b] The town of Pineville has hidden secrets and interesting places.

    "description": "[h1]What's new[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]April 28 - You can now repair or disassemble the pump. Sinks can now store more water.\r\nApril 04 - Bugfix, check release notes for more info.\r\nMarch 29 - Use pipe wrench (instead of propane torch) to build or remove pipes.\r\nMarch 21, 2024 - You can now pump water FROM rain collectors.\r\nMarch 13, 2024 - You can now connect whole buildings by connecting pipe to edge of the building. [/b]\r\n\r\n[h1] Plumbing Mod [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod lets you build a network of pipes to obtain water or fuel for various needs. You can transport water from rivers, lakes, wells, rain collectors and deliver it directly to barrels, connect whole houses to restore water after shutdown and also to irrigate farms. You can also transport fuel from gas stations to metal barrels. \r\n\r\nI spend hundreds of hours with this mod just for my pleasure. And if you like my work, you can [url=/ko-fi.com/M4M7SGR4P][img]https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nIt is OK to add this mod in the middle of the game. It works for single and multiplayer games.\r\n\r\n[h1] How does this work [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h2] Pumps [/h2]\r\nEvery network must have at least one pump. Pumps are the only means of moving the water of fuel. In particular, this means, that the liquid will not move from barrels to anywhere else without a pump\r\n\r\n[h3]Building a pump[/h3]\r\nTo build a pump, you need to access the \"Plumbing\" menu from the main context menu. The menu will be accessible once you have read Metalworking Magazine vol 2. \r\n\r\nPumps must be build next to water or fuel sources. The only water sources pump can work with are: a water tile (lake or river), a well or a rain collector barrel. Fuel sources are gas pumps. \r\n\r\nOnce you have built the pump, select \"Attach water source\" or \"Attach fuel source\".  Water tiles (lakes, rivers) will provide with tainted water, wells with fresh water. \r\n\r\nNow you can click \"Pump info\" to see details about the pump. \r\n\r\n[h3]Powering the pump[/h3]\r\nIn order to function, the pump needs electricity. You can use a power generator, but Immersive Solar Arrays mod will also work. Global power before blackout will not work. A running pump will consume 0.09L/h of fuel. When you open \"Generator info\" the pump will be listed as \"Other\". Click \"Turn on\" to start the pump. \r\n\r\n[h3]Pump efficiency[/h3]\r\nThe pump you built, will have a starting efficiency depending on you metalworking skill. You will get 10% of efficiency for every skill level. Pump efficiency will very slowly decrease over time, lowering the volume of liquid pumped. 100% efficiency is 12L/10 mins. Pumps below 20% will be additionally susceptible to emergency stops or in rare cases will start fire. Never build pumps close to your base!  A 100% healthy pump needs several months to wear out completely. Repair the pump to regain the efficiency.\r\n\r\n[h3]Water filtering[/h3]\r\nBy default, a pump provides with tainted water. If you want the pump to deliver drinkable water, you can click \"Add Charcoal Filter\" if you have charcoal in your inventory. Water filter will be slowly used over time. Use pump info to see the current status of the filter. Water is filtered as long the status of the filter is above 0%. When pumping fuel, filters do not play any role. \r\n\r\n[h2] Collectors[/h2]\r\nCollectors are objects that have the ability of storing liquids. This mod has an explicit list of in-game vanilla object that are recognized as water collectors. This list includes small and big rain collector barrels, sinks, baths, toilets and washing machines. To collect fuel, build a Fuel Tank. To fill the collector a pipe must reach to it.\r\n\r\n[h2] Connecting Buildings[/h2]\r\nIf the pipe reaches edge of the building, then all water collectors on every level of that building will be filled. The water will fill collectors one by one until full, not paralelly. Self-built houses cannot be connected. Each building must be connected individually, because building are ends of the network and will not relay water further. \"Plumb\" option is not necessary at all. If you pump tainted water, it will also be tainted in the sinks.\r\n\r\n[h2] Pipes [/h2]\r\nPipes are the only means of transportation liquid from pumps to collectors. Pipes must be placed in a consecutive manner forming a pipeline. No other objects will relay liquid. In particular, this means, that if there is a barrel between the pipes, if will receive the water, but it will not relay it any further. Similarly a connected building is the end of the network and can't relay water to other structures.\r\n\r\n[h3]Building pipes[/h3]\r\nTo build a pipe, use the \"Plumbing\" menu again.\r\n\r\nThe pipes you place will adjust visually automatically. The first pipe will be a cross, but the next one you place next to it will fix both pipes. You can build a simple network, or network with multiple forks, you can even make a loop but then you computer may explode. \r\n\r\nPipes can be built on multiple floors. Check the screenshot gallery how to achieve this. Just place the pipes in the shown order.\r\n\r\nIf you build a pipe close to a collector object, the pipe should snap to it correctly. If that does not happen it means that the object is not recognized as a collector. \r\n\r\nTo remove a pipe click \"Remove Pipe\", you will get you pipe item back. \r\n\r\n[h3]Water movement[/h3]\r\nIf the pump is on, and the pipes are connected to it, liquid will start flowing. Every in-game 10 minutes, liquid will be transported to the end(s) of the network. \r\n\r\nIf you networks forks, the liquid amount will be split. The split may be unequal in certain situations. For example if there are 13 units of water to be split across 2 pipes, one will receive 6 units, and the other will get 7 units. If there are too many consecutive splits, some pipes will not receive liquid at all, that happens when\r\nthere is only 1 unit of liquid that needs to be split. \r\n\r\nYou network can split liquid, but also join streams from multiple pipelines. Note, that the pipe however has a maximum throughput that is equal to the amount of five 100% efficient pumps. Joining streams strategy is effective if you want to transport large amount of liquid from multiple pumps using one shared pipeline.\r\n\r\nIf you mix gasoline and water in one network, the network will not work. \r\n\r\n[h2]Valves[/h2]\r\nEvery pipeline intersection has valves that can be changed. Valves are present on each ending or a pipe, so a T-shape pipe intersection has 3 valves, and the cross shape pipe has 4 valves. Valves are named by their placement, so there can be north, east, west and south valve. \r\n\r\nEach of these valves can operate in two modes\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Two-way valve - will allow liquid to flow in both directions\r\n[*] One-way valve (receiver) - will allow liquid to flow in one direction, it will allow liquid only to come in this pipe, and not come out to pipe connected to this end. \r\n[/list]\r\nValve settings will have impact on how liquid is split or merged on intersections. \r\n\r\nTo access valve information use context menu on the intersection and click \"Valve info\". This information is updated not immediately, but every 10 in-game minutes.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to change valve settings, use context menu on the intersection and click \"Change valves\".\r\n\r\n[h2]Farms irrigation[/h2]\r\nFarms built one square next to straight pipes will be watered automatically. Some portion of transported water will be used but only if the plant needs it. It works on vanilla farms,\r\nbut also with other mods using standard farming system such as Mo Crops or Farmable Trees. \r\n\r\n[h1] Troubleshooting [/h1]\r\n[olist]\r\n[*] If there are problems, launch the game in a debug mode. In context menu, there will be more options you can use for debugging such as a map of your network.\r\n[*] Incompatibility with Hydrocraft, fix: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3152142389\r\n[/olist]\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 3118159023\r\nMod ID: Plumbing",

    "description": "Elevators!\r\n\r\nThis makes it so elevators around the map actually \"function\".\r\nBasically, if the building has power (need generator if electricity is out) you can right click on an elevator and itll give you an option to go up or down only if there is an elevator tile above/below your current location. After a short wait and sfx, your character will be brought to the appropriate floor.\r\n\r\nLemme know if you find anything borked. Potential Future additions would include making the elevator require being repaired before use, or maybe button press animation. Hope you Enjoy!\r\n\r\nShould work on any map, regardless of modded or vanilla. Just to clarify, the elevator will only work if there is a valid space above/below that also has the elevator tile (if someone just places a single door as decoration, the option to use won't appear). If a modder uses their own custom imported elevator sprite it won't work though (which I doubt is common anyway) Contact me if you need a hand making your map's custom elevator sprite to work with this. Or if you just need some specific elevator for your map or something, feel free to gut this to work for your project.\r\n\r\nShout outs to Chopper and Barney for helping test this in MP environment\r\n\r\nI just made a little autorun mod too! if you want something like that check https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2732374884\r\n\r\nJust a simple mod, feel free to do what you want with it!

    "description": "[h1]About the Map: [/h1]\r\nA generally quiet river town, Rabbit Hash is known for its iconic General Store. Here, you will find all manner of goodies to help you out on your journey along the rural route to Louisville. \r\n\r\nRabbit Hash is a real-world location in KY, although it has been displaced a bit geographically and now finds itself a fair ways down the river from its former home.\r\n\r\n[h1]Map Features: [/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f In-game map support\r\n    [*]\ud83d\udd0d Foraging Zones\r\n    [*]\ud83d\ude99 Modded 'military' vehicle spawn zones\r\n    [*]\ud83e\udd7e Lots of 4-wheeler trails to sneak between various POIs\r\n    [*]\ud83c\udf3d A big fancy farm with several facilities to explore\r\n    [*]\ud83c\udfea A really cool general store with custom tiles for the sign\r\n    [*]\u26f5 A variety of docks & other infrastructure to support your boating habits\r\n    [*]\ud83d\udc6e\u200d\u2640\ufe0f A Police Station\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Technical Stuff:[/h1]\r\nRabbit Hash and its particular geometry and layout seemed to fit well into the chosen cells & surrounding road system. I feel like the map does a decent job of filling in some dead space between Riverside & West Point.\r\n\r\nThis is our first map & as such it only uses the vanilla tiles (aside from the awesome sign). The map may have some errors, feel free to comment and I'll do my best to fix anything. You may also feel that the loot is too heavy or light as I built a majority of the buildings as I went, so feel free to voice any bugs/loot/etc issues as well. Expect semi-frequent updates early on as I finish refining & polishing the map after some play-testing.\r\n\r\n[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]\r\nSo far, the only map I've found that Rabbit Hash conflicts with is North Peak. The cell is included in that map, but isn't used. Simply load Rabbit Hash before North Peak and both maps should work fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Like the map?

Just wait for some rain or snow and watch it all fade away.\n\n[h1]What does it do?[/h1]\nThis mod makes it so that when it's raining or snowing, blood will slowly fade away from floors and walls nearby.\n\n[h1]Doesn't Rain Wash do this already?[/h1]\nThat mod cleans your clothes and recent car. This mod complements that.\n\n[h1]Does it work in multiplayer?[/h1]\nYes, it does!\n\n[h1]What about ash?[/h1]\nSame as blood, ashes will also slowly be cleaned when it's raining.\n\n[h1]Can I add this to my current game?[/h1]\nYes, you can add or remove this mod whenever you like. It contains no save-breaking features.\n\n[h1]How does it work?[/h1]\nEvery game tick the mod will look at the current weather and if it's moderately raining or snowing, it will randomly select 8 tiles in the same chunk as you and clean them if they are bloodied.\n\n[h1]Why not always?[/h1]\nBecause immersion is important to me. I also opted for a more gradual process to save on performance and to give the feature the feeling of \"washing away\".\n\n\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/G2G8TCZ05][img]https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi3.png?v=3[/img][/url]\n\nWorkshop ID: 2956146279\nMod ID: RainCleansBlood",

    "description": "This adds the port city of Raven Creek to the vanilla game world.\r\n______________________\r\n\r\n[h1]WARNING! READ ALL BEFORE DOWNLOAD!BY SUBSCRIBING TO THIS MOD, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE FULLY READ THE DESCRIPTION, AND YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.[/h1]\r\n\r\nFOR VERSION 41.71\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]What you need to know:\r\n\r\nAfter EACH update for avoid bugs, you MUST start a new game. Sad but true.\r\n\r\nYou need to turn this option OFF in sandbox (Randomized house chance - set never)\r\n\r\nTurn ON in the game settings (Double-sized textures: Yes)[/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are three zones of various difficulty on the map. They have a different spawn number of infected, and other features. This map may be too hard for some people, it is not designed for beginners. Some spawn points can be very difficult, others easy. It depends on your luck. Sometimes you may appear surrounded by zombies.\r\n\r\n  Still do not forget that you personally adjust the difficulty of the game in the sandbox, if it seems to you that the map is too hard or easy, then change your own settings.\r\n\r\n  This mod does NOT conflicts with Fort Redstone. But mod conflicts with the All-In Zomboid Map Pack (AIZ), New Denver (Slocan Lake) and every other map mod that replaces the same game cells (see last screenshot).\r\n\r\n  There is a lot of loot on the map. The map was created to gain a different experience from vanilla, where there will be more action, and where there will be a lot of everything - from infected to weapons. The city was planned for fast raids with friends (or solo), and not to establish a base here.\r\n\r\n[h1]How do I get in from the standard map?[/h1]\r\n Straight west from Rosewood(upper left corner on the PZ map) until you see a road sign indicating the city.\r\n\r\n[h1]You will need a sledgehammer to get out of town[/h1]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the text in the description is limited, click on the link below to read the description in full.

    "description": "Do I really need a hammer to move a couch?\nI wish I could move this desk, but I haven't taken any carpentry classes!\n\nThis mod removes the nails holding your furniture and appliances to the floor!\n\nDetails:\n- Furniture and appliances require no skill/tool to move.\n- Fixtures like cabinets and shelves still require skills/tools.\n- Break chance for props requiring skills/tools has been reduced to 30% at skill level 0, 20% at 1, 10% at 2, and 0% for >=3.\n- Break chance for props not requiring skills/tools is now 0%.\n- Sinks in vanilla have no associated skill and receive a 25% break chance default. Changed to 0% since apparently no skill is required!\n- All the above only applies to \"pickup\" and \"place\" actions. Disassembly should not be affected by this mod.\n\nThe mod works by \"whitelisting\" props if their name matches certain patterns. This implies that the patterns may catch too much or too little, so feel free to provide feedback if you think some props should or should not require a skill/tool.\n\nNote: Not compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2685057281]Safer Prop Moving[/url]\n\nDisclaimer: There could be big bugs in this mod! The vanilla lua code has numerous edge cases, please comment if you discover issues.\n\nWorkshop ID: 2699828474\nMod ID: RebalancedPropMoving",

    "description": "Ever regretted hotwiring that sweet sportscar? Ever got your hotwired car stolen by your friend and who then (somehow) managed to flip it? Or do you just want to become a local car key salesman, perhaps a famed car keysmith?\r\n\r\nThen you're in the right place!\r\n\r\nRefined Hotwiring allows you to un-hotwire your hotwired car or, with a little metalworking knowledge, create keys for them, all from the comfort of your vehicle radial menu.\r\nCompletely works and supports your favourite (vehicle radial menu-using) mods:\r\n- Better Lockpicking\r\n- Harry's Functional Tow Truck\r\n- Autotsar Trailers\r\nand more!\r\n\r\nFeatures and skill requirements:\r\n- Now featuring Custom Sandbox options, made singlehandedly by albion! Change the skill requirements of un-hotwiring and keycrafting to better fit your playstyle!\r\n\r\n- Un-hotwiring! Removes the hotwiring from the car, allowing it to be started using a key.\r\nRequires Electrical 2 and Mechanics 3 and takes 500 units of time to complete.\r\n\r\n- Key crafting! Gain a key to the car you're sitting in.\r\nRequires Electrical 1, Mechanics 2 and Metalworking 3, and takes 1250 units of time to complete.\r\n\r\n- Base hotwiring is unchanged!\r\nIt still requires Electrical 1, Mechanics 2 or the Burglar skill, and takes 200 units of time to complete.\r\n\r\nThe time needed to complete these tasks get shorter the higher your Electrical knowledge is!\r\n\r\nDoes something not work as it should?\r\nPlease visit the mod's github page and open an issue under the \"Issues\" tab, or comment below using the Steam Workshop comments system. I will do my best to help!\r\n\r\nPlease give feedback on the mod!\r\nFor now, the Burglar trait does not allow you to bypass skill requirements for un-hotwiring or crafting car keys, because in my mind, Burglars learnt to break into homes and cars, but not how to delicately craft car keys or undo their damage. If you think this should be changed, please make yourselves heard!\r\n\r\nMod's github page: https://github.com/VilcsiTH/refinedhotwiring\r\n\r\nOriginally based on raz's \"Harder Hotwire\" mod, it has been completely rewritten to better follow vanilla skill requirements and better compatibility for Build 41.65+ aswell as other mods.(This means it also works for 41.78!)\r\nThis rewrite is, in no small part, thanks to raz and other talented people such as iBrRus and Aiteron, whose mods helped shape this mod into what it is today.\r\n\r\nPlease check them out and give them lots of love!\r\nHarder Hotwire by raz: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2164926937\r\nAutotsar Trailers by iBrRus: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2282429356\r\nBetter Lockpicking by Aiteron: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2368058459\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to these awesome people for translating the mod!\r\nTurkish by zizaderien: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056212111\r\nPortugu\u00eas Brazilian by ZL18k: https://steamcommunity.com/id/deibig\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2687515849\r\nMod ID: refinedhotwiring",

    "description": "The Research Facility, KY is a full expansion and redesign of the secret military base that can be found to the west of Rosewood, KY. It's design is inspired by the sprawling complex of Black Mesa from the Half-Life series, as well as from the town of Eureka from the TV show Eureka (2006).\r\n\r\n[img] https://i.imgur.com/EEVrGqY.gif [/img]\r\n\r\nThe facility conducts advanced research in the areas of high tech aerospace engineering, plant sciences and advanced biomedical research. The facility contains a several large research facilities, a satellite launch facility, a small heliport, a military outpost and a company town to house the employees of the facility.\r\n\r\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\r\nThe entire facility is surrounded by double wide, unclimbable military grade fence, and at the time of gamestart the facility has been placed on a full lockdown. This means it will be impossible to get past the main gate with a car until you [b] have a sledgehammer [/b] (you can still climb the front gate). The zombie population are very high within the facility, but there are many valuable looting areas and many army vehicle spawns making it a much more attractive late-game looting spot compared to its vanilla counterpart.\r\n\r\n[b] \"The Biomedical & Engineering Facilities are on full lockdown with shutters blocking off all entrance and exits, if the system worked the infection will be contained\" (hint: there are ways in/out without a sledge) [/b]\r\n\r\nYou can spawn within the base, but the spawns are VERY high so it will be a very tough start in terms of numbers if playing on normal or above.\r\n\r\n[b]An optional addon is included that connects the Research Facility to Rosewood via a proper main road (see worldmap image for cells)[/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]Compatability[/h1]\r\nThe map uses the cells 18,41 / 18,42 & 19,41 / 19,42.\r\n\r\nWorks well with...\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1516836158] Fort Redstone 2.0 [/url] - This mod was specifically designed to support the new incarnation of Fort Redstone, and does not overlap any of its cells at time of writing.\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2196102849] Raven Creek [/url]  - [b]LOAD Raven Creek AFTER THIS MOD![/b] Tested with this mod and works fine (they come up right against each other but dont overlap)\r\n[/list]\r\nIncompatible with...\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Slocan Lake (Sort of works, you must put Slocan Lake (and Raven Creek etc) AFTER Research Facility.\r\n[*] Rosewood Access Road (breaks half the map) and is not needed (This map contains its own access road).\r\n[/list]\r\n[h1]Multiplayer / Server [/h1]\r\nMake sure you go into the server settings, map, and then add this map to the list and move it up to the top of the list to ensure it prioritizes generating the new area rather than the base map (not sure why its an issue within this map). \r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Special Thanks[/h1]\r\nDaddyDirk for his tile mod, and his excellent YouTube series that taught me how to map!\r\n\r\n[h1]Support Updates and More Content[/h1]\r\nLike the map and want to see more?

I am planning to update this mod to B42 as is, and then publish a V2 rework with underground stuff. I havent done PZ mapping in a while so itll take me a bit to get my head around it to.

It is (for now) missing the map mods contained within the B41 version of the mod.\r\n\r\nFeel free to play with the update, but please read the workshop description before downloading. I've explained how to use the mod now that you can't repair at the designated buildings anymore. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409422147]Click here to go to the B42 page[/url]\r\n\r\nenjoy :) please leave comments for that build over there\r\n\r\n[h1] Bring the power and the water back! [/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the ability to restore the power and water grids in Knox Country, optionally comes with both a custom power substation and water treatment building to restore their respective utility at!\r\n\r\nTo repair the power or water, you'll need some electric skill, along with electronic scrap and optionally any \"fuses\" you come across that will give various bonuses to your repair. But be aware that your patchwork repairs will only last so long, you'll have to come back and repair it again at some point!\r\n\r\nTo initiate repairs, find the building that houses the utility you're trying to repair and head into the room with the PC in it (with the brown square floors), then simply right-click anywhere while standing in the room and you should see more information on how to repair!\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you don't want to use my map mod, there are alternative options for setting up repair zones. See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2986067947/4363501716021462652/] this guide [/url] for more details!\r\n\r\n[h2] Maps that support this mod [/h2]\r\n\r\nIf not using any of the following, you can enable the Restore Utilities Map submod (included in the mod download) to add 1 place to repair each utility at, locations can be found in the mod preview screenshots on the steam workshop page.\r\n\r\nThank you to you wonderful map makers who have added support for this mod in your maps :D\r\n\r\n[h3] Maps where you can restore the power [/h3]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2802755864] Trimble County Power Station & La Grange [/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3170914649] McAlpine Locks and Dam [/url]\r\n\r\n[h3] Maps where you can restore the water [/h3]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3279818805] Filtration Plant [/url]\r\n\r\n[h1] Known conflicts [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h2] Map/mod conflicts!

Though if you've already generated the chunks where the utilities are then I don't think they'll regenerate as my mod's buildings, so you'll have to add coordinates where you can repair by yourself (enable debug mode in singleplayer or have admin powers in mp)!\r\n\r\n[h2] MP Compatibility [/h2]\r\n\r\nWorks perfectly fine in MP, both dedicated host and local host! Though for larger servers you may want to consider adding your own repair locations in harder to reach areas than default. You may also want to consider changing the default sandbox settings!\r\n\r\nAlso probably incompatible with your immersion if you enjoy a hyper-realistic zomboid, power and water networks require a lot of smart people in a lot of different places, a single person probably wouldn't be able to do it all. :p\r\n\r\nAlso probably incompatible with your immersion if you enjoy a hyper-realistic zomboid, power and water networks require a lot of smart people in a lot of different places, a single person probably wouldn't be able to do it all. :p\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2986067947\r\nMod ID: restore_utilities\r\nMod ID: restore_utilities_Map\r\nMap Folder: RU_MulSubstation\r\nMap Folder: RU_RosWaterTreatment",

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582810?utm_source=sos]It's called Dandelion Void, and you can wishlist it here![/url]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h2]Please Read - Build 42 Development[/h2]\r\n[quote]\r\n[b]Yes, B42 support is planned. No, we don't have an estimated time for it.[/b]\r\n\r\nWe will not be pushing any more patches for B41, as we've already committed to the B42 code structure internally, and have not run across any relevant issues in the last year. Any announcements regarding B42 Development will be posted here and also on the various PZ discords.\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h2]Repair the Emergency Broadcast System[/h2]\r\n[quote]\r\nDo you...\r\n[list]\r\n[*]...find yourself late in the game with nothing to do?\r\n[*]...want new areas to explore in Knox Country?\r\n[*]...take your hourly weather updates and air traffic alerts for granted?\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Save Our Station[/b] spices up your survival experience by causing the Automated Emergency Broadcast System to occasionally suffer service outages. Travel to weather stations scattered around Knox Country to find, diagnose, and fix the broadcast system.\r\n\r\nWhilst the AEBS is built with emergency scenarios in mind, the backup systems can only last so long...\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[h2]How it Works[/h2]\r\n[quote]\r\nAt the end of every emergency broadcast, the system's integrity will be reported, communicating the status of the Emergency Broadcast System.\r\n\r\nOnce the power shuts off in Knox Country, there's a chance the Emergency Broadcast System will fail.\r\n\r\n[b]System Faults[/b]\r\n\r\nWhen a system fault occurs, the network will run a self diagnosis - a process that may take several days. Upon completion, a location and diagnostic code will be broadcast. \r\n\r\nRefer to NWS - National Weather Service - Diagnostic Manuals and NWS Registers to find and troubleshoot the issue. \r\n\r\nThe NWS Diagnostic Manual will tell you what is wrong, and the items needed to resolve thefault. The NWS Register will tell you where to find the weather station in trouble. \r\n\r\nEnter the control room of the appropriate weather station, and perform the repairs by right clicking on one of the weather terminals. Once the repairs are complete, the next Emergency Broadcast will be broadcast loud and clear... until the next fault occurs!\r\n\r\n[b]System Inturruptions[/b]\r\n\r\nFor a more punishing experience, system interruptions can be enabled from within your sandbox settings.

This can lead to thousands of symbols created.\r\n\r\nProject Zomboid has a 2,097,152 bytes limit for player objects when saving them to the database. Player objects include inventory, which may include a Shared Map created with this mod. Now, if you created a map containing thousands of symbols, you may hit the 2MB limit, meaning that your player cannot be saved anymore. If that happens, you will see a red box error in the bottom right corner.\r\n\r\nThis simply means that you cannot keep that map item in your inventory, because it contains too much data (the thousands of \"dots\" created by Draw On Map). After using the map (e.g. remembering annotations), you can drop it on the ground, store it or delete it, and your character should be fine again.\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/E0TTrTs.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/I2I6D0YS4][img]https://i.imgur.com/ULMwSUt.png[/img][/url]\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2815560151\r\nMod ID: BLTAnnotations",

Finally, the color of Screwdriver on the icon is the same as its game model!\r\n- Now you can use Tree Branch as weapon. Yes, you read it right!\r\n- Fixed blood overlay. Now blood on weapons will appear where it should - at the point of impact!\r\n- Spears made from branches and spears made from planks are now visually different now. Small but nice detail!\r\n- New recipes for upgrading your Baseball Bats. Wanted to wrap some wire around a bat? Now it's possible!\r\n- New recipes for creating improvised weapons.

It is the premier institution for piano instruction in the greater Muldraugh area.  They have rated many piano pieces based on difficulty from Levels 0 - Level 10.  Only those who have studied the piano can play pieces above Level 0.  Using the patented KCCM system, anyone can learn to play the piano at a virtuoso level!\r\n\r\nLower your boredom/unhappiness/stress as you play the piano.\r\nPractice the piano (raising boredom) for the greatest xp gains.\r\n\r\n4+ new pieces are unlocked at every level!  Ten pieces at level 10!\r\n\r\nWarning:  Playing the piano can be heard in the world by nearby zombies and players\r\n\r\nNew Animation - watch the new PlayPiano animations while playing the piano (Automatically installed for 41.51+)\r\n\r\nController and Multiplayer co-op support!\r\n\r\n-This mod is compatible with existing saves.\r\n-ONLY Build 41.50 requires the Extra Skills System\r\n-Players will walk to the front of the piano to play\r\n-The amount of boredom, unhappiness, and stress reduced is small for easier pieces, but the reduction increases with the difficulty level of the piano piece.\r\n-Stop in the middle of playing, and you will still get a partial reduction in boredom/unhappiness/stress\r\n-Piano levels go from 0-10.\r\n-Practice is available from levels 0-4, and generates more xp (and boredom) than playing alone\r\n-There is a maximum amount of xp you can earn practicing or playing - don't overdo it\r\n-Pianos always face south or east\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to AuthenticPeach for teaching me about PZ animations and Fragmotion.  Without AuthenticPeach, I'd be using the loot animation for playing the piano.\r\n\r\nThanks to Soul Filcher.  This would *just* be a Simple Playable Piano without the Extra Skills System.\r\n\r\nThanks to Koteczek for PL translations!\r\n\r\nThanks to Chuck and Yooks for helping me with questions while I was making this mod\r\nThanks to everyone who helped with my Playable Arcade Machines mod, which I borrowed from heavily to do this mod.\r\n\r\nInformation for copyright holders:\r\nThe author of the mod respects the copyright of the copyright holders and all musical works (piano recordings) in the mod do not imply commercial use or any other benefit.  All pieces of music in this mod are used exclusively to create a realistic piano gaming experience.\r\nAny piece of music (piano recording) as part of this mod will be immediately deleted after contacting the official pro-owner.  If you are the official copyright holder and want to remove from the mod - a piece of music that violates your related or copyright contact:\r\n\r\nhttps://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/messenger/compose/&to=40411\r\n\r\n***** FAQ\r\n\r\n- How do I install the new animations?\r\nIf you are playing with build 41.51 or newer, you don't have to do anything!  The custom animations are installed automatically.  For build 41.50, contact me and I will send you manual instructions.\r\n\r\n- Is manual installation required?\r\nNo.  In Build 41.50, if you do not manually install the new animations, you will see the Loot animation when you play the piano.  Otherwise, it will work fine.\r\nIn Build 41.51 and after, the new animations will be installed automatically.\r\n\r\n- Why do I see a surrender animation when I play the piano?\r\nYou have enabled animations in the code, but don't have the new animations in the anim_x folder.  When the code can't find the .x files, it defaults to surrender.  Check the installation instructions and place the .x files in the anim_x/Bob folder.\r\n\r\n- Why do I see the loot animation when I play the piano?\r\nThe code defaults to the loot animation, and must be manually changed.\r\nIf you already modified the code to use the new animations, it could be because an update overwrote your change.  Please change it again.\r\nIf you haven't modified the code to use the new animations, that is why you are seeing the loot animation.\r\n\r\n- Why do I have to manually install the animations?\r\nYou only have to if you are using build 41.50.\r\nIn build 41.51 PZ started supporting automatic install of custom animations.\r\n\r\n- When I try playing the piano, I get an error.\r\nIf you are in build 41.50, make sure you have enabled the Extra Skills System, which is required for the Simple Playable Piano mod in 41.50\r\n\r\n- What did you use to create the animations?\r\nFragmotion\r\n\r\n- Can you help me use Fragmotion?\r\nNo.  I barely know how to use it and have no plans to use it again.\r\n\r\n- Why have I stopped gaining xp in piano skill?\r\nThere are limits to how much xp you can gain in around 7-8 hour time window.\r\n\r\n- What are the limits to xp gains per day?\r\nYou can gain up to 3000xp in a 7-8 game hr period\r\nYou can also only practice for up to 360 seconds worth of sounds (not adjusted for fast forward) per session.  After 180 seconds you start to see diminished benefits.  This refreshes 7-8 hours after you practice.\r\nYou may play for up to 800 seconds worth of pieces for full benefit.  After 1200 seconds of play, benefits go way down (xp goes down to 0).  This refreshes 7-8 hours after you play.\r\n\r\n- Why can't I practice piano anymore?\r\nPiano practice (accelerated xp gains) is only available until you reach level 5.  After that you play to gain xp.\r\n\r\n- What's the best way to gain Piano levels quickly?\r\nPractice 360 seconds (real time, before fast forward) up til level 5, then take a 9 hour break before doing it again.\r\nAfter level 5, play 1200 seconds (real time, before fast forward) to gain up to 3000xp, then take a 9 hour break before doing it again.\r\nYou will not be able to gain many levels per day, and at higher levels it should take you more than a day to gain a level.\r\n\r\n- Are there piano skill books?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n- Why are there no skill books?\r\nI wanted to make sure the rate of skill increase was good even if you didn't have a skill book.  Adding a modifier for having a skill book would just make gaining piano levels go too quickly.\r\n\r\n- What is KCCM?\r\nThe Knox Country Conservatory of Music (KCCM) was founded in Muldraugh in 1993.  It is the premier institution for piano instruction in the greater Muldraugh area.  They have rated many piano pieces based on difficulty from Levels 0 - Level 10.  Only those who have studied the piano can play pieces above Level 0.\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2465017864\r\nMod ID: SimplePlayablePianos4150",

    "description": "Welcome to southwood version 2.0!\nSouthwood is the predecessor of Riverside. Unlike the world line in Kentucky in 1993, the original site of Riverside has not been gradually abandoned due to relocation. On the contrary, it has explored a new development model and become a small town that mainly relies on industry and agriculture and animal husbandry to achieve economic prosperity.\n\nIn the current version, southwood has been extended to 3 \u00d7 3cells. You can explore a whole McCoy factory requisitioned by the army, a huge riverview house for you to live in, and complete animal husbandry facilities and farmland to prepare for the b42 version. In addition, there are all kinds of new ordnance stores waiting for you to plunder!\nRemember to prepare a sledgehammer when you get to the center of town!\n\nThis map occupied cells are mentioned below\n(12,19)(13,19)(14,19)\n(12,20)(13,20)(14,20)\n(12,21)(13,21)(14,21)\n\nWorkshop ID: 2947314444\nMod ID: Southwood2.0\nMap Folder: Southwood2.0",

    "description": "This mod is an updated version of Conqueror Koala's Standardized XP series for B41 multiplayer.\n\nStandardised Aiming XP: Removes the vanilla aiming XP nerf after level 4\nStandardised Reloading XP: Removes the vanilla reloading XP nerf after level 4, and has options to make reloading XP less random (or more)\nStandardised Sprinting XP: You will gain a set amount of XP every 15 seconds while sprinting, in addition to the vanilla slow and random XP\nStandardised Nimble XP: You will gain a set amount of XP every 10 seconds while in combat stance, in addition to the vanilla slow and random XP\nStandardised Passive XP: Allows you to configure the rate of XP given to the passive skills (fitness and strength) by every method other than exercise (There are plenty of other mods that change exercise XP rates)\n\nGenerally, this mod will allow characters who don't start with points in skills such as sprinting and nimble to still be able to gain some levels in them, and characters that do will be able to get much further than in vanilla. It also makes it possible for characters who don't start with a point in aiming to eventually be able to use rifles.\n\nFeatures can be toggled and configured using sandbox variables - you can grant xp multipliers to specific skills as well as many mod-specific options.\nThe entire series (Standardized Aiming, Standardized Reloading, Standardized Nimble, Standardized Sprinting, Standardized Passive) are included in one mod. If you only want to use some of them, you can disable the others with sandbox variables.\n\nThis mod works on old saves, but if you're playing singleplayer you'll need another mod to change the sandbox settings. Sandbox settings are not applied immediately - return to the main menu and load after changing them, or restart your server.\n\nIf there are any errors or you have any suggestions, please let me know!\n\nWorkshop ID: 2759857133\nMod ID: STXP",

With this mod, you have the ability to select any desired quantity of items from a stack in a container, as well as transfer them into the container that is currently in focus.\r\n\r\nNormally, when interacting with containers, you can only choose to grab one item, half of the stack, or the entire stack. However, with this mod, a convenient 'select amount' option is introduced. By clicking on it, a user-friendly textbox opens up, allowing you to enter the precise quantity of items you wish to take.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if you intend to transfer items from your inventory to a container, the tooltip now indicates which container is currently in focus, making the process even more seamless and intuitive.\r\n\r\nEntering negative numbers, non-digits won't do anything, your game will not crash or throw errors. Numbers larger than the maximum amount will transfer all items.\r\n\r\n[h1]Does this work on existing saves?[/h1]\r\nYes, you can add and remove this mod at anytime\r\n\r\n[h1]Does this work in multiplayer?[/h1]\r\nYes\r\n\r\n[h1]Translations[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]English\r\n[*]German\r\n[*]Spanish (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198874558693]CarlosRojasCu[/url])\r\n[*]Russian (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198815716743]AstraTangens[/url])\r\n[*]Traditional & Simplified Chinese (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164560009]NEP IS LIFE[/url])\r\n[*]Polish (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015940192]Kenji338 [/url])\r\n[*]Thai (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047485926]Riko Prushk[/url])\r\n[*]Turkish (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199157204232]BayGlitch[/url])\r\n[*]Italian (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017474880]LONIX[/url])\r\n[*]Korean (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032294270]EAST[/url])\r\n[*]Portuguese Brazilian (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199062290230]thecarvalhogamer [/url])\r\n[*]Japanese (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141612519]Flandre Mayor[/url])\r\n[*]French (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044775963]ChocoMaxXx[/url])\r\n[*]Ukrainian (by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198298250745]daniilsan347[/url])\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]All other languages have been translated with [u]Google Translate[/u][/b], if you find errors or want to improve something head over to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2985394645/3835424749185807635/]translation discussion[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Check out my other mods![/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780594299]Refillable Lighters[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985394645]Take Any Amount[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2785427414]Pool Ball Set[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2860417716]Decorative Food[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2916530733]Fast Reload[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920624796]Pill Duration[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/luulZghost/myworkshopfiles]Or click here to visit my workshop page![/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Permission[/h1]\r\nYou can use this mod in your own creations, but please credit me if you do so.\r\n\r\n[url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php/topic/2530-mod-permissions] [img]https://i.imgur.com/JzzJD3q.png[/img] [/url]\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2985394645\r\nMod ID: TakeAnyAmount",

In addition, the duplicate clothing shelves found in the recreational_sports_01 sheet, that were identical to the normal shelves but non-functional, are now functionally the same.\r\n[*] Coat racks are now containers with a capacity of 10, and have a new clothing overlay that appears on them.\r\n[*] Non-corner hardwood wall shelves (double shelves you can build) fill up visually with more than books; in kitchen room types, they use the same overlay as metal shelves.\r\n[*] Hair salon dryers and barber's poles can now be picked up.\r\n[*] Distillery shelves and barrels can no longer be walked through and can be picked up and dismantled for wood.\r\n[*] Red mobile tool cabinets now have surfaces, allowing items to be placed on them, and the IsLow flag to allow placement of higher tiles above them.\r\n[*] Steel medical counters (like found at the [url=https://map.projectzomboid.com/#13227x2970x6170]Med-U-Well[/url] in south Louisville) can no longer be walked through, can be picked up and dismantled, and count as containers with a capacity of 50.\r\n[*] Surgeon degree certificates and eye test posters have the IsLow flag to allow placement below e.g doctor degree certificates.\r\n[*] Medical mirrors count as mirrors (for purposes of e.g applying makeup).\r\n[*] Microscopes can be picked up.\r\n[*] Bathtubs facing north and west can no longer be walked through and now have plumbing and water supplies.\r\n[*] Wall showers can be plumbed.\r\n[*] Urinals can be plumbed and have a small water supply you can drink from (flush and enjoy).\r\n[*] Gym mats and basketball hoops can be picked up.\r\n[*] Large animal troughs can no longer be walked through and can be picked up and dismantled for metal sheets.\r\n[*] Pizza whirl garbage bins function properly as trash bins and can be used to delete items inside.\r\n[*] Wall bins are containers that function properly as trash bins (as above).\r\n[*] Fossoil, beige shop, and Zippee magazine shelves can be picked up and dismantled.\r\n[*] Concrete road blocks no longer have a cutaway effect when near them like walls.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nSafe to add to an existing save, with the only caveat being that in areas you've been to before, certain tiles with new functionality\u2014such as furniture newly made into containers\u2014will not be functional as such unless you pick it up and re-place it yourself. It also goes without saying that loot won't spawn in new containers except in new areas, but luckily, you're unlikely to miss out on much other than money (how often can you say that?).\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2961722002\r\nMod ID: TileFixes\r\nMod ID: TileFixes_ParkingGateNoStop",

    "description": "[h1]Tread's Military Vehicle Zone Defs [41.65+][/h1]\nThis mod adds Military Vehicle Zones (Vehicle Spawn Zones/Parking places) to the game map. It was made for 41.65 version of a game and should work both in SP and MP. Nonetheless I had limited testing capabilities so all bug reports are welcome.\n\n[h3][b]Shoutout to map creators:[/b][/h3] I would be very grateful if you can scan my \"objects.lua\" from map folder for any clashes with your maps. IF any exist please report them to me so we can think about making mods fully compatible. Obviously I am also ready to assist, should you wish to place any of my custom spawn zones on your maps.\n\n[b]New game strongly recommended[/b] - otherwise this mod will have VERY limited effect.\n\nIt bases off NATIVE (VANILLA) map of the game [41.65] and adds military vehicle spawn zones to it.\n[b]It will not add any military vehicles, if you do not use any other mod containing them.[/b] To make this mod do anything, you need at least one other mod that adds vehicles using \"military\" Spawn Zone Definition. Those spawn zones were not existing on native map, but were used by some custom maps.\n\nExample of mods adding such military vehicles:[list]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510950729]Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars[/url]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2490220997]KI5's mods (military ones)[/url],\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2705655822]M113 APC by Papa_Chad[/url].\n[*]etc. (more names listed in compatibility discussion)[/list]\n\nMilitary spawn zones I added are spread around Native map and mostly focus on military objects. Nonetheless you can still find some random spawn location here and there.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/p7Fv1Z6.gif[/img]\n\n[h2]Scope of the mod[/h2]\nThis mod not only adds spawn locations for \"military\" zone (military vehicles as added by mods) but it splits this spawn list into multiple custom classes (light vehicles, heavy vehicles, trailers, burnt etc.). Each custom class is filter based and includes specific vehicles I chose. I tried to include all suitable vehicles from each \"military vehicle\" mod I found on the mod release date (01.02.2022).\n\nEvery military vehicle not listed in my filters will get automatically added to general \"military\" class and to \"light vehicle\" class (as the most popular one).\n\nAs a bonus this mod assigns whole \"military\" vehicle spawn list to the existing \"army\" parking places (merges the lists). I found a few of those already existing on the Native map. Probably TIS added them as a preparation for adding army vehicles in the future updates. Once TIS adds their vehicles, \"army\" list will include Native ones and any added by mods into \"military\" list.\n\nLast but not least, most of spawn zones copy existing spawn rates (as they were defined in Vanilla or the last mod editing spawn lists).\n\n[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b]Any strange military spawn is probably not cause of this mod. E.g. if one of your other mods assigns \"Ice Cream Truck\" to \"military\" or \"army\" spawn list, Ice Cream Trucks will show up in military bases etc. It is not fault of my mod but the one that wrongly assigned this car to spawns. My mod adds no vehicles on its own and \"reads\" spawn lists of all other loaded mods.\n\n[h2]How to use:[/h2]\nSP: Activate the mod as usual.\nMP:[list][*]    Both server and clients need the mod,\n[*]    Clients should activate the mod as usual,\n[*]    Server should add mod to its configuration as usual,\n[*]    [b]Server should add MAP[/b] by adding \"TreadsMilitaryVehicleZoneDefs\" (without quotes) in its \"Maps=\" line of config ini. It has to be added BEFORE \"Muldraugh, KY\". If you have trouble please google how to add custom maps in MP game.[/list]\n\n[b]Mod should be activated before start of new game or server.[/b] Adding it mid-save is possible but its effects will be almost non-existant. All the custom spawn places will not work and the only effect of adding mod mid-game will be making native \"army\" vehicle spawn locations work (only on yet unvisited parts of map).\nAddition of additional (not active on world start) military vehicle mods is possible on ongoing saves. Those vehicles should get properly added in all yet unvisited areas.\n\n[h2]Technicalities:[/h2]\nDue to description lenght limit I move it to discussion. Topic probably of interest only to other modders.\n\n[h2]Future:[/h2]\nI am not a professional programmer, experienced modder nor hardcore Zomboid gamer. I made the mod for myself and a few friends to include on our server. I thought that it might be useful for others therefore I share it on Steam Workshop. I will try to update the mod from time to time and fix any bugs found. Nonetheless I do not promise I will have time and skill to do it on any regular basis.\nIf you wish to fuel my modding activities please consider supporting me:\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/tread][img]https://i.imgur.com/SHnNA1r.png[/img][/url]\n\n[h2]Credits:[/h2]\nI wish to thank a few people (and groups):\n[list][*]TIS - for making this great game,\n[*]Kraz - I studied Fort Redstone folder structure and lua's to understand how map zones and map mods folder structure work.\n[*]KI5, Filibuster Rhymes, Papa_Chad and other vehicle modders - for the military vehicles this mod can spawn[/list]\n\n[h2]Compatibility:[/h2]\nThis mod should be compatible with most maps. Nonetheless there is a small chance that some map and some of my spawns might clash. IF they alter exactly same squares on the native map. Please report such cases so I can search for solution.\n[b]Vehicle mods compatible with filter function[/b] (as of 01.02.2022) - only \"heavy\", \"burnt\" and \"trailer\" vehicles count - all light ones are sorted OK by default:\nList can be found in designated discussion - suggestions welcome!\n\n[h2]Usage of my code in other mods:[/h2]\nI do allow usage of my code in other Zomboid mods. If you decide to do so please credit me in description.\nI cannot promise regular updates and long-term support therefore I do allow fixing, upgrading, updating etc. my code and uploading its adjusted versions.

    "description": "[h1]Tread's Paint Symbols [41.65+][/h1]\r\nWere you surprised to find out that in Project Zomboid you can paint only 5 signs using brush and can of paint? I found vanilla selection of painted signs lackluster (softly speaking) and decided to do something about it.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 33 new symbols, that you can paint on walls and signs (using Vanilla functionality and items). I also added ability to paint digits, letters and some special characters.\r\n\r\nI am no artist (rather a coder), but managed to turn some icons (I found online) into tileset used for those signs. Some of them could be improved upon - if any tile artist would like to refine/swap them then I would gladly accept help.\r\n\r\nMod should work both in SP and MP. It also should be safe to add and remove mid-game (painted custom signs will disappear after mod removal).\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr][b]If you encounter bugs, crashes etc. PLEASE report them[/b] - it is the only way I can fix them. [hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Features of this mod:[/h2]\r\n[list]\t[*]Reworked and added categories to \"paint sign\" context menu,\r\n\t[*]Addition of 33 new symbols that can be painted,\r\n\t[*]Addition of alphanumeric characters (and some special ones) as paintable signs.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/p7Fv1Z6.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to fuel my modding activities please consider supporting me:\r\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/tread][img]https://i.imgur.com/SHnNA1r.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[h2]Languages (context menu categories):[/h2]\r\n[list][*] English (EN)\r\n\t[*] Polish (PL)\r\n\t[*] Please post your Translations in proper Discussion[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Credits:[/h2]\r\n - I wish to thank Pertominus for showing me easy way of transforming flat icons into \"isometric\" ones.\r\n - Big thanks to [url=https://iconmonstr.com/]iconmonstr.com[/url] for all icons I used.\r\n - Big thank you to icon authors from NounProject.com, whose work I used in this mod:\r\n[list]\t[*] Rifles by Alexander Skowalsky ,\r\n\t[*] Baseball Bats by Hea Poh Lin,\r\n\t[*] Axes by Alena Artemova,\r\n\t[*] Scope by Benjamin Sommerlad,\r\n\t[*] Bulletproof by R\u00f6hl Jonas,\r\n\t[*] Books by Orin zuu\r\n\t[*] Vhs by Zane Ogle\r\n\t[*] First Aid by AS Design\r\n\t[*] Cleaning by \u0412\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u041f\u043b\u0443\u0442\r\n\t[*] Resistor by IconMark from\r\n\t[*] Tailoring, Kitchen, Vegetables by Adrien Coquet\r\n\t[*] Gasoline by Simon Child\r\n\t[*] Canned by Chattapat\r\n\t[*] Steak by zidney\r\n\t[*] Ice Cream by Andrejs Kirma\r\n\t[*] Wood, Armchair by Andre Buand\r\n\t[*] Metal Beam by Bakunetsu Kaito\r\n\t[*] Gardening by YANDI RS\r\n\t[*] Sports Car, Compact Car, Van by Blaise Sewell[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Usage of my code in other mods:[/h2]\r\nI do allow usage of my code in other Zomboid mods.

These dances expressed prayers for rain, sunshine, fertility, protection, and forgiveness.\r\n\r\nDancing is exactly what you need in these difficult times. That is why we have published the magazine \"Dance\".  Explore 45 different dance moves by finding and reading the issues of our new magazine.\r\n\r\nWe'll remind you that the general partner of the magazine is TMC, the producer of the \u0441ereal, Kosmotsars.\r\n\r\nKosmotsars are lovingly made from 100% natural ingredients and whole grains, which is why they are so nutritious and healthy. Each cereal pack contains one trading card that will give you access to a unique dance move. Delight your family with a delicious breakfast, and your neighbors with a wonderful dance.\r\n\r\n[img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1660101375273576639/0C12E325C464F5DC166E5FF2AB70A43581BED64F/[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]FAQ:[/h1]\r\n[b]How to dance?[/b]\r\nOpen the emotion menu (press and hold Q) and select the appropriate item.\r\n\r\n[b]Will the mod work if I add it to an existing save?[/b]\r\nYes, it will.\r\n\r\n[b]How do I learn the dance?[/b]\r\nYou need to find and read a dance magazine.\r\n\r\n[b]Do I necessarily need a magazine to learn a dance?[/b]\r\nAt the beginning of the game, each player knows 3 random dances. The remaining dances can be learned from the magazine, or find a trading card.\r\n\r\n[b]What are the trading cards for?[/b]\r\nWhen a trading card is in a player's inventory, a special dance becomes available to him. Each card has its own dance.\r\n\r\n[b]Can I learn the trading card dance?[/b]\r\nNo, the dance will only be available if the card is in a player's inventory.\r\n\r\n[b]Where can I get trading cards?[/b]\r\nThe cards can be found in the \u0441ereal, Kosmotsars. These boxes of \u0441ereal appear on store shelves, in houses, and in other places where \u0441ereal should appear.\r\n\r\n[h3]Credits:[/h3] \r\nThanks to AuthenticPeach for help with this mod.\r\n\r\n[url=boosty.to/_tsar][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/5071647734847773052/9BE2EEBC53FDD151A5B6DF9290E46BEADC060DDA/[/img] [/url][url=pz.ibrrus.ru/mods/][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/5071647734847775404/33396705B3590231ED4B47752B428995037DA72C/[/img][/url]\r\n[url=discord.gg/xkCEcwGZMW][img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1783982255480129217/A3B05641944B7BE1D25604929C4B7C49663617C5/[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nYou can freely use this mod on your server.

    "description": "This version of True Music Jukebox is for Build 41. Norby has now updated it for Build 42 as well, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3398874593]and it can be found here.[/url] Keep in mind that [b]Build 42 does not have multiplayer yet.[/b]\r\n\r\nAre you tired of swapping cassettes and vinyls after every track? Is the effort to find batteries doing more damage to your sanity than the zombie apocalypse, itself? Well, now you can load hundreds of cassettes and vinyls from the infamous True Music into a handy multipurpose jukebox and dance until you're undead! And the music syncs on multiplayer!\r\n\r\n1. [i]First[/i] [b]remove[/b] [i]and then[/i] [b]unsubscribe from[/b] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3059476842]the old version of True Music Jukebox[/url]! (!!!)\r\n2. Get [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613146550]True Music[/url] (and it's prerequisites)\r\n3. Subscribe to some good True Music track packs.\r\n4. Find or build yourself an epic jukebox (but don't forget electricity)!\r\n5. Turn it on, fill it with cassettes and vinyls, and crank it up to ELEVEN! *\r\n\r\n[h2]How to Use Jukeboxes[/h2]\r\n\r\nTo use a jukebox, simply interact with it once after finding or placing it in the world and turn it on. This will convert the jukebox into a container object. After that, you can move (or \"load\") True Music cassettes and vinyls into the jukebox. Once tracks have been loaded, you can play them using either any loaded track's inventory menu or the jukebox interaction menu. Powered jukeboxes will play continuously. You can create a queue of specific tracks that will play next in the loaded playlist, and you can lock the queue if you want to loop through a subset of loaded tracks.\r\n\r\nJukeboxes can hold ELEVENTY arbitrary Zomboid weight units (110 AZWU) of your finest tapes and vinyl records. There is no track limit.\r\n\r\nBy default, zombies will be attracted to the sound of the jukebox up to 50 squares away. The range at which zombies can hear a jukebox at full volume can be set using sandbox options.\r\n\r\n* Jukebox sound is controlled by Ambient Volume in sound settings.\r\n\r\n[h2]Jukebox Therapy and Nutrition[/h2]\r\n\r\nJukeboxes can be given the power to improve the moods and health of players who hear them in many ways; they can even quench your thirst if you want them to be that magical. These features are off by default; enable them in sandbox options if they are up your alley!\r\n\r\n[h2]Jukebox Icons[/h2]\r\n\r\nThis mod features icons to help people navigate its menus nonverbally. All buttons still do what their button text says they will do; buttons that say \"play\", \"enable\", or \"turn on\" do exactly that. However, the icon for buttons that toggle things on and off will reflect the CURRENT state of that option, [b]not[/b] the state it will be in after it's pressed. We made this decision because we wanted the icons to appear \"on\" when the associated toggle is \"on\" - e.g., the Jukebox icon is green when it's on. This pattern can be inverted on our game options page.\r\n\r\n[h2]Portable Jukebox Keys[/h2]\r\n\r\nWant to remotely access a jukebox's playlist and queue? Simply enable portable jukebox keys via sandbox options, add a jukebox to your key ring via the jukebox's main menu, and open the context menu on your (or any) key ring to control the box at any range. You may rename jukeboxes to remember locations more easily. Controller input is supported via the in-game keyboard.\r\n\r\n[h2]Range Options[/h2]\r\n\r\nIn sandbox options, you can determine the audible sound range of the jukebox (a special setting exists for zombies); note, however, that our option for players will only work if you use our custom sound mode (the default sound mode of this mod). If you are using Project Zomboid's 3D sound effects, however, be aware that we are not able to control the sound range; it will drop off in volume according to whatever is deemed realistic by Project Zomboid.\r\n\r\n[h2]Jukebox Hero[/h2]\r\n\r\nWant to get a jukebox as fast as possible? Just choose the Jukebox Hero trait at character creation, and you will spawn with a Jukebox Starter Kit for building your very own jam station! You will also learn a recipe for making jukeboxes out of scrap.\r\n\r\n[h2]3D Audio Effects[/h2]\r\n\r\nTrue Music boomboxes and cassette players use 3D audio effects that many people find annoying because they have excessive bias toward one ear, and that ear is often the wrong ear (it's based on player position, not head orientation). We do not like the sound of that audio, so we replaced it with something we like much better. [b]However[/b], you may enable that form of 3D audio using both game options (for the individual level) and sandbox options (if you want to force your entire server to use the same 3D sound as True Music). Just be aware that we do not control the audible range of that sound mode.\r\n\r\n[h2]Multiplayer Sync[/h2]\r\n\r\nWe have spent many hours confirming that you will hear the same songs as other people, and tracks will change at [i]almost[/i] the same time. Feel free to contact us if you believe you have ideas that can significantly improve this aspect of the mod!\r\n\r\nWe have not seen any desync in testing lately; however, if for some unexpected reason a jukebox does become desynced for one or more players, there are two things that will likely fix this. If the data is only wrong clientside, reconnecting should fix the issue; if the jukebox data is somehow corrupted serverside, then picking up a jukebox and putting it back down will reset its data.\r\n\r\n[h2]Game Options[/h2]\r\n\r\nTrue Music Jukebox now has its own page in the Game Options menu, where players can control a wide range of settings from jukebox volume to hiding menu options.\r\n\r\n[h2]Translations[/h2]\r\n\r\nWe want True Music Jukebox to be available to every player in every language! Please learn more via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3118990099/4035852798885773535/]our permanent discussion about language support[/url].\r\n\r\n[h2]Update Schedule[/h2]\r\n\r\nWe will push feature updates on [b]Sundays at 10 PM EST[/b] whenever those updates are ready.\r\n\r\n[h2]Discord Server[/h2]\r\n\r\nCome join [url=https://discord.gg/3a3dWFB6yw]the True Music Jukebox community[/url] on Discord! In the future, we plan to warn people there if we need to do an unscheduled update for any reason (such as bug fixes that we consider urgent). We are also able to respond to usage questions, bug reports, translation requests, and feature suggestions faster on Discord. Please join us!\r\n\r\n[h2]Compatibility[/h2]\r\n\r\nThis mod was written and will continue to be improved with compatibility as a high priority. It was tested alongside hundreds of mods, and it was fully compatible with all of them. It also integrates smoothly with Lifestyle: Hobbies. If you have any information regarding a potential incompatibility, please visit us on Discord and ping us!\r\n\r\nYou can add this midsave. Starter kits and manuals will not spawn in places that the server has already initialized with items.\r\n\r\n[h2]Modpacks[/h2]\r\n\r\nPlease [b]read[/b] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3118990099/4139439021818677235/]our Modpacks discussion[/url].\r\n\r\n[h2]Other Mods by Norby007[/h2]\r\n\r\nSee my other mods for mixed insanity:\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2878074695]SuperGigaMart[/url] - It's like shopping on Black Friday!\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042138819]FunctionalAppliances[/url] - Now with More Brews!\r\n\r\n[h2]Other Mods by Burryaga[/h2]\r\n\r\nBurryaga is a Wookiee.

The terminals can also revert the music back off the playlist if you want to change it back. If you switch the terminal options, all radios on those channels will update and play a new song. So you can use it to resync immediately or switch songs but it's always random.\r\n\r\nJust added in v1.11 the terminals will now start with some random music media in them but it does not pull tracks to the terminal channels immediately. You still need to make the trip out. Also the terminal on the western wall has an option to eject media. It will allow random spawns of media from that terminal. I will be working on a way to choose a title in the future so you can download the songs of your choice. The new sandbox settings allow control of the amount of media found in each terminal. The west terminal eject system is also limited to the same spawn amounts and the ability disappears once empty.\r\n\r\nAdded in v1.13 play radios everywhere in single player with immediate world sync. In multiplayer the music must stop and be restarted between world switching as radios in inventories and backpacks can only be heard by that player.\r\n\r\nAdded in v1.18 you can now turn off all TMRadio station music on all radios with mod options. Great for streamers that need to control the music.\r\n\r\nAdded in v1.21 an admin can now activate terminals to control the 94FM and 94.2FM stations that are not at the station. This will help custom maps to control the music. Even though multiple terminals can change the music, only one can control the music list at a time. The last one that updated will be the one in control.\r\n\r\nAdded in v1.27 radio stations can be moved in the sandbox settings.\r\n\r\nAdded in v1.29 an admin can now remove songs from the global list so that the 5 music stations will never play those songs unless overridden by playing them from the terminal list directly. The admin can go through the terminal menu and add and remove songs from the list. The sandbox is also updated to choose to remove the theme music with TrueMusic, the additional songs added by TCCacheMP, or just the holiday music from the TCCacheMP mod.\r\n\r\n[h1]Known issues:[/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1][b]***On servers you may need to set anti-cheat 21 as false if it kicks players, it seems to be a generic failure involving corrupted mod files that differ from server to client.***[/b][/h1]\r\n\r\nThey way this works now, no longer needing script codes from the broadcast, just turn on a radio and tune in to one of the 5 stations. It will start a song immediately but if someone already started a song on that station it will be out of sync until the next song is played. Then both radios will be in sync.\r\n\r\nHandheld and inventory radios are not heard by other players in multiplayer.\r\n\r\nHandheld radios are only heard by the owner in multiplayer but zombies will still hear them unless you use a headset. New in v1.13 zombie attraction has a toggle and is default to off.\r\n\r\nDisassembling running radios will cause the audio emitter to detach, have not written a fix for it yet but on the way.\r\n\r\nStation location in southwest Riverside: https://map.projectzomboid.com/#4835x6283x6360\r\n\r\n[h1]Updates:[/h1]\r\n\r\nv1.28\r\nAdded - ability for the admin to activate the other 3 channels for control through a terminal, by default only the first 2 could be controlled\r\nAdded - ability to turn off the theme music from the radios in the sandbox\r\n\r\nv1.29\r\nAdded - Blacklist for admins to remove music titles from the lists\r\nAdded - Sandbox settings so that the theme music, TCCacheMP music, or just the TCCacheMP holiday music can be removed from the lists\r\n\r\nv1.30\r\nfixed - bug with empty blacklist causing client mod data issues on disconnect\r\n\r\nv1.31\r\nUpdated to b42, work around to get tapes and records to drop until True Music is updated, can be used without True Music or the cache for now.\r\n\r\nUpdated the terminals at the radio station to control all 5 stations.\r\n\r\nUpdated to include a mumble removal (this may affect other mods so it needs to load separately).\r\n\r\n*** Now compatible with the new mod \"TV & Radio ReInvented\" as I have added the tuning decorations for those interfaces when that mod is being used in B42 ***\r\n\r\n***Warning, some TM add-on mods are causing errors that are caused by old item spawning locations that do not exist in B42, they will need to remove those missing locations from their script files to stop the errors***\r\n\r\n[h1]The new multiplayer true music jukebox is now available![/h1]\r\n[b]True Music Jukebox[/b]\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3118990099\r\nWorkshop ID: 3118990099\r\nMod ID: TrueMusicJukebox\r\n\r\nSuperGigaMart!\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2878074695\r\n\r\nCorner Store Candies and Sodas Fixed\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3073297673\r\n\r\nFunctionalAppliances - Now with More Brews!\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042138819\r\n\r\nNew Discord - A work in progress: https://discord.gg/cEZc6rBuHz\r\n\r\n[h3] [b] Huge shout out to Burryaga and Lazarus for their help in programming and testing!

(For example, you cannot mount a red dot sight on most handguns, excluding the DE Pistol, and the Magnum Revolver.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[h2]Reworks to Jamming[/h2]\r\nIn vanilla when a weapon jams it consumes a round when it is unjammed. With VFE the round is returned if the gun is completely unloaded before clearing.\r\n\r\nJamming probability curve has been completely rewritten. In vanilla a 90% M16 only has a 50% chance of getting through a magazine without jamming. Now guns only begin to jam at 75% or 70%. They also start to jam more than vanilla guns do at 25% or 20%. Basically high condition guns jam less (or not at all) and low condition guns jam more often.\r\n\r\nManually cycled guns can jam now. Pump shotguns and bolt action rifles do their jam calculations when a round is chambered.\r\n\r\n[h2]Zombies[/h2]\r\nMany more zombies in the world can spawn with firearms on them. Survivor zombies have also been given a bit touch up.\r\n\r\n[h2]Sandbox Options[/h2]\r\nQuite a few aspects of the mod is configurable via sandbox settings. This is mostly toggles as to where VFE puts its guns, but also contains a multiplier for weapons in normal houses. An option exists to disable spawning of the M60 Machinegun, if such is desired.\r\n\r\nThis version of the mod is not final, we will continuously update adding new things and changing old ones.\r\n\r\n[h2]FAQ[/h2]\r\nQ: Is this mod compatible with Brita's/Arsenal26?\r\nA: No. They are incompatible at the lua level. VFE is also designed around its own balance design, so using both at the same time doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nQ: I took an attachment off a weapon and it won't go back on.\r\nA: You have a soft mod incompatibility. Another mod is overwriting attachments.\r\n\r\nQ: A weapon doesn't accept an attachment that makes sense\r\nA: Usually same story as previous question, but there is a chance it was missed. If its still true with just VFE in the modlist, report it. Also make sure you have a screwdriver in your inventory.\r\n\r\nQ: Can this mod be installed mid save?\r\nA: Yes and no. The new guns will spawn in unexplored locations, but guns already spawned will still retain their old stats, like damage and range. If you do decide to add it to an existing save you will have to delete and respawn all the guns you already have. The same is true with uninstalling. (when it comes to weapon stats)\r\n\r\nQ: Does this mod have suppressors?\r\nA: No. They're not off the table but they are also not a priority.\r\n\r\nQ: Why are some guns invisible?\r\nA: Maxwell's suppressor mod causes this when that mod is out of date. That is a problem with that mod, not VFE itself.\r\n\r\nQ: Why are some guns tiger striped/rusted/wrong textures?\r\nA: Issue with the texture optimization mod. Basically VFE changes textures for its models, but the texture optimization mod reverts them to vanilla.\r\n\r\n[h2]Final Notes[/h2]\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs, dislike something, or just have ideas you'd like to see incorporated into this mod, please let us know in the comments!\r\n\r\n[h2]CREDITS[/h2]\r\n\r\nStendo_Clip - Models, Textures, Scripts, Lua\r\nSpuchel - Textures, Icons, Scripts, Lua, Animations\r\nVilespring - Models, Textures, Scripts, Lua\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to TedEBear of Serious Survival Roleplay for sponsoring the M60 and several other firearms.\r\nSpecial thanks to Alec for letting us use his magazine models from his mod, Ammo & Magazine icon MOD.\r\nSpecial thanks to Great Hero J for creating various pixel art sprites that VFE uses as item/interface icons.\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2667899942\r\nMod ID: VFExpansion1",

THEREFORE THE AUTHOR GRANTS ANYONE THE RIGHT TO FEEL FREE TO USE THE FILES CONTAINED IN THE MOD AS THEY SO CHOOSE.  UPDATE THE MOD FOR B42 OR USE THE FILES AS A SPRINGBOARD TO CREATE YOUR OWN MOD, THE AUTHOR GIVES YOU HIS FULL BLESSING.  FEEL FREE TO POST YOUR UPDATES AND YOUR OWN VERSIONS TO THE WORKSHOP.  MAYBE JUST GIVE CREDIT WHERE DUE IF YOU FEEL LIKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10/28/2023 The Step Van Update\r\n\r\n**** READ! READ! READ! ****\r\nTHIS MOD REPLACES SOME STOCK FILES AND TEXTURES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STARTING A NEW GAME BEFORE USING THIS MOD. DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU MESS UP YOUR SAVE FILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver 400 skins based on real world vehicles with realistic paint colors! Included are new wheels as well as textures for the wrecked and crispified versions also!\r\n\r\nThis mod got started when I got tired of looking at all the weirdly pastel colored cars that spawn in the game by default so I decided to try and make things a bit more realistic. This basic goal got out of hand probably due to a case of OCD and this mod is the result.\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces all textures for all vehicles in the vanilla game except for the trailer which I might do for a future update. The aim of this mod is to enhance the look of the default vehicles and to add some much needed variety to the vanilla motor pool.\r\n\r\nThere are now three different types of police cars; a standard police car, a sheriff's car, and a state trooper car. These skins are based on the mod \"Proper Police Skins\" by S\u00f6ze with permission. You don't need both mods for this to work but you will have to pick one or the other as they do conflict with each other.\r\n\r\nThis mod will likely have problems working alongside any mod that messes with the files for the vanilla cars. I have tested this mod with a few vehicle related mods and have encountered issues with two mods for sure: Eggon's Worthwhile Cars and the Crashed Cars mod. Eggon's Worthwhile Cars causes some vehicle's textures to not show up properly and the Crashed Cars Mod causes the textures for the wrecked cars to not show up properly. This issue persisted no matter what order I ran the mods in. If you are fine with these problems you can continue using those mods.\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2788428718\r\nMod ID: VVehicleEnhancer",

    "description": "This mod adds new vehicle spawn zones and spawn lists around KY. These new spawn zones range from adding some vehicle spawns to areas that did not have any, to adding new themed spawn areas that provide a more specific set of vehicles. In total, there are over 1000 new spawn zones scattered around the map. Note: the preview screenshots were all taken with vehicle spawn rate set to High, to better showcase the new spawn areas.\r\n\r\n[h1]This mod was originally made for my car pack [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791656602]here[/url] and has support for it.[/h1]\r\nVehicles from the pack are also featured in the screenshots. This started as a means to more reliably find the very rare cars from the pack without increasing their overall spawn rate, and sort of expanded from there into its own mod. Many of the spawn lists here were made for cars in the pack, so they work well together.\r\n\r\nThis mod primarily does 2 things:\r\n\r\nThe first is placing more spawn zones around the map, both vanilla spawn lists and new ones detailed in the next part. These are mostly in areas that didn't have spawn zones already, such as rural houses, small neighborhoods on the outskirts of towns, and other locations that seemingly should have spawn zones.\r\n\r\nThe second is adding new themed spawn lists that provide more specific selections of vehicles. These spawn zones are placed all around the map, and are usually consistent with their respective vehicle themes. Check the discussions for a description of each of the new spawn lists and where you might find some of the spawn zones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Vehicle Mods (For the new spawn lists):\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2788635598]KV's Vehicle Bonanza[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2809058492]1993 American Vehicle Pack[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510950729]Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars![/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2759339330]W900 Semi Truck[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2567438952]'89 911 Turbo (930)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2478247379]'67 Cadillac Gage Commando[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618213077]'89 Oshkosh M911[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2734164805]P.A.R.C.[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1687801932]DeLorean DMC-12[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2771297715]Skizot's Riding Mower[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2768264215]Skizot's Go Kart (manual spawn version recommended)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835977984]Marc's Bugatti EB110[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791656602][img]https://i.imgur.com/RJXyg7i.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nSupported maps (For the new spawn zones):\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2707344076]Redstone Raceway[/url]\r\n\r\n[b][u]Big thanks to Funnypig for the support for these following mods[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783373547]Skizot's Ice Cream Truck (Freezer version)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783580134]Skizot's Garbage Truck[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2781895054]Skizot's AE86[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2689292423]'89 Toyota Supra (A70)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2756615186]'89 Mazda RX-7 (FC)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2727969941]ZAW Sputnik 26 (Trabant 601)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2748047915]VW Transporter (T3)[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/KI5/myworkshopfiles/?appid=108600]Various KI5 Vehicles[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198386727404/myworkshopfiles/?appid=108600]Various Mr.Danny and ATA Vehicles[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2282429356]Autotsar Trailers[/url]\r\nVarious [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/bls13/myworkshopfiles/?appid=108600]cyt[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004947199/myworkshopfiles/?appid=108600]shark[/url] vehicles\r\n\r\n[b][u]Big thanks to Panopticon for the support for the following mods[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2849455153]Special Emergency Vehicles & FBI for Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars![/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930796403]Fox's Extra Police[/url]\r\nSeveral more KI5 vehicles\r\n\r\n[h1]Note about some mod vehicle's spawns[/h1]\r\nSome mod vehicles use farm as an alternate spawn zone, particularly military ones since there was no official military/army zone for a while. This mod uses farm spawn zones quite often, so I've included some optional mods that will attempt to disable the farm spawns of some mods. I'll likely try to add more, so please report any odd farm spawns in the discussions or comments.\r\n\r\nI'll be adding support for other vehicle mods and along the way, and other modders can use these spawn lists in their own vehicle's spawn lists and map mods. Supporting custom maps is also something I would like to implement in the mod.\r\n\r\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Q: How does it interact with map mods in Knox Country?[/b]\r\nA: It can be used with map mods, but currently there are no new spawn zones for new areas added by maps. As long as the maps don't significantly alter vanilla towns/neighborhoods layouts it should be fine, and worst case scenario is that the spawns will be in odd spots. It will also work with Ekron, since I did not place any spawns in that area.\r\n\r\n[b]Q:Can it be used with any mod/map, even if it's not on the supported list?[/b]\r\nA: Yes! Mods not listed will still benefit from the newly placed zones for vanilla spawn lists, they just will not be in the newly added spawn lists. Maps will still work normally, check the above Q.\r\n\r\n[b]Q:Does it work with other spawn zone mods (Military Vehicle Spawn Defs, Vehicle Scenes, KES Town Specific spawns, etc.)?[/b]\r\nA: Yes, it should work with them. I will adjust any overlapping spawn zones I find, but it should be OK to use with such mods.\r\n\r\n[b]Q:Where should the map be in the map order?[/b]\r\nA: The map (MotoriousExpandedSpawnZones) can be anywhere in the map order, but it might work best just above the base game map (Muldraugh, KY). Addon maps for other map mods should be [b]above the original mod's map[/b] or the zones will not work. Remember though that the base game map should be at the [b]bottom of the in-game map list, or the end of the server .ini map list,[/b] as with all map mods that add to the base map.\r\n\r\n[b]Q:It says I'm missing a required mod, what gives?[/b]\r\nA: [h1][b][u]No other mods are required for this mod to function. Every addon besides the base mod (ID: fhqExpVehSpawn) is optional, and alters certain aspects of the mod or provides compatibility for something else.[/u][/b][/h1] If you don't know what the required mod is, disable the sub mod that requires it. The descriptions for each addon will tell you what they do, and what mods they require if they do, but are [b][u]not[/u][/b] required for the mod to work.\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2793164190\r\nMod ID: fhqExpVehSpawn\r\nMod ID: fhqExpVehSpawnGageFarmDisable\r\nMod ID: fhqExpVehSpawnM911FarmDisable\r\nMod ID: fhqExpVehSpawnP19AFarmDisable\r\nMod ID: fhqExpVehSpawnNoVanilla\r\nMod ID: fhqExpVehSpawnRedRace\r\nMap Folder: MotoriousExpandedSpawnZones\r\nMap Folder: VehicleSpawnZonesExpandedRedRace",

In Vanilla, stored-up water leaves a near infinite supply of easy safe water even after the water shutoff, making keeping up with thirst trivial.\n[h1]Water Drain[/h1]\nThis mod also features water draining from the taps over time to add further urgency to securing a water source.\n[h1]Filters[/h1]\nThis also introduces the need to filter plumbed taps.

Feel free to use them as seen fit just please give credit where its due. thanks and enjoy\r\n\r\nThanks to ThrottleKitty for use of a wall which i coloured changed,Skizot for the Massage Chair Textures, Daddy Dirk for use of his ikea shelves for a overlay. \r\n\r\nModID: Ryu Tiles\r\nWorkshop ID: 3003792372\r\n(sorry about the different name then the posted name. im a idiot and didn't know what to call it when i started so you get ryu for the pack and me for the release name)",

    "description": "This Mod attempts to make masks (such as gas masks) affect the sickness gain from corpses.\r\nIt does not protect against engine fumes inside buildings.\r\n\r\nCondition of the mask is considered.\r\n\r\nGas Masks offer full protection at 100% condition.\r\nOther specific masks as surgical masks half protection at 100% condition.\r\nLastly, items such as Balaclavas, Bandanas, etc. offer 25% protection at full condition, if they cover the mouth and Nose.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported mods:\r\nAuthentic Z, Shark's Law Enforcement Overhaul, Shark and Peach's Military Uniform Improvements, Brita's Armor Pack, Swatpack, ADVANCED GEAR, Paw Low Loot, Undead Survivor, Scrap Armor, Toxic Fog, They Knew, Stalker Armor Pack, slyy's Spicy Attire, Asura Chi, Insurgent - Black Ops Profession\r\nSee the discussion thread for a detailed list and protection values,\r\nAny masks added by unsupported mods will work normally, but not offer any protection.\r\n\r\nBetter Masks Mod provides it's own compatibility mod. It uses different protection values than described above.\r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest other masks to support or balance changes.\r\n\r\nShould be safe to be added to or removed from an ongoing game as no items are being modified.\r\nI have not tested it in MP, any feedback is welcome, if you give it a try.\r\nFeedback so far has been positive.\r\n\r\nAdding this mod to a modpack is permitted, if credit is given and a link to this workshop page is included.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, the source code for this mod can be found here: https://github.com/jaype87/WorkingMasks\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks goes to Werlias for creating the video!\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2760742937\r\nMod ID: WorkingMasks",

Take the vaccine at about 80-90% (when you do the test, the percentage of infection is indicated in the name) or ~65 hours after the bite(infected), the main thing is not to miss the moment.\r\n---IF THE VACCINE CLEARED THE INFECTION - Congratulations, that's it all.\r\n---IF NO, GO FURTHER:\r\n-Make albumin, this thing prolongs the effect of the vaccine and pushes back the zombification.\r\nUse a 1 dose of albumin at about 50-60% of the infection.\r\nAfter an hour or two of game time, do a second test.\r\nThis is how you can watch the zombification flow.\r\nWhen you reach 50-60%, use albumin again.\r\nWhen the albumin ceases to act, you can inject the vaccine again.\r\nTHIS WAY YOU WILL EXTEND ZOMBIFICATION UP TO 6-9 DAYS ON ONE VACCINE (1 lvl) (for example)!\r\n-------------\r\nChinese translation added, big thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199244235491]??[/url]\r\nSpanish translation added, thanks a lot [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/truesamu]Samu[/url]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/fVVaDCS.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[url=https://discord.gg/RnTWZnv5Ap][img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chuckleberry-Finn/chuckImages/main/PZmodCommBanner2.png[/img][/url]\r\n[h2]You can support me:[/h2]\r\n2202 2053 2225 5867 SBER (MIR)\r\nhttps://boosty.to/kerhus/single-payment/donation/493985\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 2914364562\r\nMod ID: ReModVaccinDrReapersMP",

    "description": "[h1] Overview [/h1]\r\nThis mod won't let you freeze your butts off during zombie apocalypse. \r\nActivate air conditioners and stay hot during winters. \r\nCooling is also possible but works only in single player games. \r\n\r\nIf you like my work:\r\n[url=/ko-fi.com/M4M7SGR4P][img]https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[h1] How does this work[/h1]\r\n[h2] Obtaining Air Conditioners [/h2]\r\nAC units cannot be crafted, but you can find them in game already installed on some building walls. They are usually located on industrial buildings, warehouses, but also there is one in Muldraugh bakery. You will need to simply pick them and take them home to your base. \r\n\r\n[h2] Placing Air Conditioner [/h2]\r\nTo activate the air conditioner you do not need to learn any skills nor tools.\r\n\r\nPlace the air conditioner outside your base on a wall behind which you want heat to be generated. Right click the air conditioner, and select \"Attach\". This needs to be done only once after placing the unit on a wall. \r\n\r\n[h2] Operating Air Conditioner [/h2]\r\nAir conditioners will naturally work only when power is available. Vanilla generators, but also solar panels will work. Right click air conditioner, and simply select \"Turn on\". Turning off is similar.\r\n\r\nClick \"Settings\" to access a panel to change temperature and fan speed. Temperature is self-explanatory; the fan speed controls the radius of heat propagation. This mod uses in-game algorithm for heat propagation which is not perfect. You may notice that sometimes heat is blocked for no reason. I cannot fix this but you may experiment with different A/C placements or using more than one unit. \r\n\r\nAC units can also be controlled remotely. To do so, you will need to use a TV remote. Click \"Settings\" on the remote in your inventory list. The remote will control nearby unit as long as it is not too far. If there are multiple units in range, you will control the one that is closer to the player. The player will face in the direction where the AC unit is, this way you will know that unit is being controlled. You can control units only on the same floor.\r\n\r\n[h1] Other [/h1]\r\nAir conditioner will consume a constant amount of fuel. \r\nAir conditioner does not not to be repaired.\r\nAir conditioners do not generate any toxic gas. \r\nIt is safe to add the mod in the middle of the game. It is also safe to remove it which is not recommended ;)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know of your ideas in the comments. I will try to implement them. Also please let me know if you find any bugs.\r\n\r\nid=3071370537\r\nModID: AirCond",

    "description": "[h1]Sensors[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod allows you to craft sensors of various types, and apply them to objects to initiate an automatic action. Additionally sensors may trigger sound alarms or initiate explosions.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] You can add a light sensor to a lamp so that it turns on automatically during night. Using sensors will allow you to conserve energy. If you you Immersive Solar Arrays, the efficiency of your setup will be improved greatly Additionally you will extend lifetime of your bulbs.\r\n[*] You can add a proximity sensor to a gate so that it opens when player is near. This way you do not need to exit your car to open or close the gate\r\n[*] You can add a power sensor that detects power shortage and turns on a (secondary) generator\r\n[*] You can place a zombie sensor with a electric shock module that will guard your base\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Sensor Types[/h2]\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [th]Type[/th]\r\n        [th]Trigger[/th]\r\n        [th]Threshold[/th]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n    [td]Light Sensor[/td]\r\n    [td]The sensor measures daylight value and sends a signal when light level is below given threshold.[/td]\r\n        [td]intensity\r\n(min:0.0, max:1.0)[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [td]Player Proximity Sensor[/td]\r\n        [td]The sensor measures the distance between Player and the object and sends a signal when distance is below given threshold.[/td]\r\n        [td]distance[squares]\r\n(min:0, max:10)[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [td]Zombie Proximity Sensor[/td]\r\n        [td]The sensor measures the distance between Zombie and the object and sends a signal when distance is below given threshold.[/td]\r\n        [td]distance[squares]\r\n(min:0, max:10)[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [td]Player Room Sensor[/td]\r\n        [td]The sensor sends a signal when both the sensor and the player are located in the same room of a building.[/td]\r\n[td]N/A[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [td]Temperature Sensor[/td]\r\n        [td]The sensor sends a signal when temperature on the square where it is located is below given threshold.[/td]\r\n[td]degrees[celcius]\r\n(min: -50, max: 50)[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [td]Rain Sensor[/td]\r\n        [td]The sensor sends a signal when rain intensity is below given threshold.[/td]\r\n[td]intensity\r\n(min: 0.0, max: 1.0)[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [td]Power Sensor[/td]\r\n        [td]The sensor sends a signal when the power is available to the object the sensor is attached to.[/td]\r\n[td]N/A[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/table]\r\n\r\n[h2]Applicable Objects[/h2]\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n        [th]Object[/th]\r\n        [th]Action[/th]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n    [td]Light sources (lamps or lightswitches)[/td]\r\n    [td]If a sensor is attached to a lamp, it will be turned on.

You will need to have at least electric skill level 2\r\n[*] Click on the object you want to add sensor to, and select  \"Add Sensor\" option\r\n[*] If you want to remove the sensor, simply select \"Remove Sensor\" option.\r\n[/olist]\r\n\r\n[h2]Tuning Sensors[/h2]\r\nTo adjust sensor settings such a sensitivity, you will need to use a desktop computer. You must subscribe to \"The Computer\" by KONIJIMA mod. Turn on the computer and right click on computer keyboard, an option to reprogram the sensor will be available. \r\n\r\n[h3]Threshold levels[/h3]\r\nNot all sensor types have threshold levels and threshold levels min and max values are different for every sensor type. \r\n\r\n[h3]Invert[/h3]\r\nYou can check \"invert\" to invert the threshold rule. For example , for temperature sensor is threshold is 26 it will send positive signal when temperature is below 26C, but when you check \"invert\" it will send positive signal when the temperature exceeds 26C.\r\n\r\n[h3]Modules[/h3]\r\nSensor has module slots that can be added for extra functionality.\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Battery slot - sensor need power to operate. If there is no external power, the sensor can use the battery. Battery will deplete slowly each time sensor activates. \r\n[*] Speaker slot - you can add amplifier module, this way sensor will trigger sound alarm when activated. The alarm will bring more attention however.\r\n[*] Arm slot - you can add armed traps here, see below\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h3]Armed Traps[/h3]\r\nThe traps are danegerous for zombies and players no matter who triggers them. So watch out! To craft armed traps you will need to find and read \"Electronic Magaize vol 6 - Traps\".\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Shock trap - it will electrocute characters within sensor range. Electrocuted zombies' movement will be limited and finally zombie will become a crawler. Players will fall down and their movement will be limited. No damage is inflicted apart from the damage that is possible due to the bump fall. The trap is persistent, it does not vanish after firing.\r\n[*] Glass trap - it will explode and kill almost all zombies in the sensor range. Players will suffer from deep wounds with glass shards. The trap fires once and then the sensor is gone\r\n[*] Nails trap - similar to glass trap, but without glass shards, but slighly more painful. \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nTraps will not work on players that are sneaking.\r\n\r\n[h2]Roadmap[/h2]\r\nFeatures below are not implemented yet, but I am thinking about adding them.\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Other sensor types: Time sensor - activate at the given hour/minute\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Bugs[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Light bug - happens for some external light sources, probably modded ones. Destroy the object where sensor is placed when this happens. \r\n[*] If you you pick up the object you will lose a sensor. Remove it first, move object and add sensor again. \r\n[*] If you want gates to work correctly, add sensor to the edge of the gate, where the hinges are, not the center. \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop ID: 3209239259\r\nMod ID: LightSensor",

Full zombification is irreversible at all... The wakling dead will never be human, your friend, brother, sibling or anyone else anymore again... After injection of the preventive vaccine infection rolls back to 5%, it is possible to prolong the vaccine effect by taking course of albumin... Got infected?! Use the vaccine! On the early stage of infection before 30% it contributes to the recession of the virus... It will help you to fight the early symptoms and prolongs the vaccine effect... At 65-75% percent of infection use albumin, it will roll back the infection too... But it's effectiveness is limited to course of approximately 7 pills... Then repeat the vaccination course! And start anew... Until you research the vaccine!\n\n- To create it You'll need laboratory equipment, basic knowledge, chemical reagents... It is necessary to research books about laboratory work so you were able to establish one yourself and to synthesize the vaccine... You may find necessary reagents in some warehouses... And samples of infection which you need to collect from zombies... And blood of alive infected person!\n\n- Yes, only blood of a still living person contains necessary antibodies...

    "description": "Hotwired cars may now stall when starting the engine or driving at high speed(especially offroad). There's a very small chance the hotwire comes loose and must be done again from scratch.\nThis is separate from the multiple times required to start a car, when the car engine is damaged. This will even apply to 100% cars, as long as they are hotwired.\n\n20% chance to get sparks when starting the car( this will stall the car immediately).\n2% chance to get make the hotwire come loose if the sparks fly (so in reality the % is 20% -> 2% ( making it way smaller than 2% )\nWhile driving, the car can have up to 1% chance of the wires getting sparks (when driving on-road it barely goes above 0.5%) and the check is doen every minute, which makes the chance to stall at any time very small.\n\nI made this because I would always hotwire cars, even if I had the keys. This makes hotwired cars a bit more scary to use and makes players prefer keys, if possible.\n\nWorkshop ID: 2738969410\nMod ID: ahotwirenerfmod",
