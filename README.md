# Project Zomboid Web-Panel
## Version 0.7
### This project was made specifically as a hobby and the code is pretty buggy (you have been warned)

All code in this project was made by me and some help with ChatGPT for some HTML designing and such.

## Usage Guide
This is pretty short and sweet but is NEEDED to run this.

### !CREATE A FOLDER FOR ALL OF THIS TO GO IN!

There are many places in each file where specific directories will be required to be named that tailors to your device like your Zomboid folder and other directories.
It is preferred to use Visual Studio to edit any code in this project, and look up variables. I'll specify them as well.

### Running the website

Currently it is hosted on the client for testing purposes!!

Open your **Powershell** and input "cd ~/project-zomboid-panel" **(Use this command only if it is located in the *User* folder)**
Then, run "venv/Scripts/activate" which puts your **Powershell into venv.
After that just run "python app.py"!! And that is all!
Based off my testing, it should work on your **localhost**

For example this link opens the dashboard: http://localhost:16261/dashboard

## That is all for current testing!
